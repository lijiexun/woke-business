Prior theory suggests that expertise should influence creativity assessments, yet examples abound of experts in different roles disagreeing about whether the same idea is creative. We build and test a social context model of creative idea recognition to show how decision-maker roles can shift creativity assessments. In an experimental study, we show that relative to non-decision-making roles, decision-making roles inculcate an economic mindset and so lead to downgrading otherwise creative ideas with cues of low social approval. A quasi-experimental study triangulates and extends this finding showing that organizational decision-making roles can habitually evoke an economic mindset that shapes creativity assessments. In both studies, decision-maker role, economic mindset, and social approval levels were unrelated to idea usefulness ratings. By integrating work on organizational roles, economic mindsets, and implicit theories of creative ideas, we provide a broadly applicable theoretical framework to describe how social context shapes creativity assessments. This work has important implications for the creativity and innovation literatures, and suggests a new interpretation of the longstanding puzzle of why organizations desire but often reject creative ideas.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2013.0887","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['social context', 'economic mindset', 'creativity', 'social approval']","The article discusses how decision-maker roles and economic mindsets influence creativity assessments, indicating a consideration of social factors in organizational decision-making.

We propose that as a result of a process of trait activation, employees with different types of self-construal engage in distinct forms of proactive behavior if they work in environments consistent with their self-construals. In an experimental Study 1 (n = 61), we examined the effect of self-construals on proactivity and found that people primed with interdependent self-construals engaged in more work unit\u2013oriented proactive behavior when job interdependence was also manipulated. Priming independent self-construals did not enhance career-oriented proactive behavior, even when we manipulated job autonomy. In a field Study 2 (n = 205), we found that employees with interdependent self-construals working in jobs with high interdependence reported higher work unit commitment and higher work unit\u2013oriented proactive behavior compared to employees in low interdependent jobs. Employees with independent self-construals working in jobs with high autonomy also exhibited stronger career commitment and more career-oriented proactive behavior than did those in jobs with low autonomy.

Previous research has focused on how routine participants bring particular intentions to the performance of a routine and choose the means for accomplishing the pre-defined ends accordingly. Drawing on the pragmatist theory of action and a yearlong ethnographic study of a pharmaceutical company, we uncover \u201cemerging intentionality\u201d in routine performances. We show how the foregrounding of means within the concrete situation at hand might lead to the emergence of new ends to pursue. Moreover, we find that the emergence of new ends in routine performances might result in updating the goals for the routine and its associated patterns. With these findings, we contribute to a better understanding of the full spectrum of intentional action in routine dynamics, ranging from purposeful action (foregrounding ends) to purposive action (foregrounding means).

Pay for performance (PFP) for inventions is associated with two challenges: Low-quality inventions may be rewarded (false positives), and high-quality inventions may be overlooked (false negatives). Building on previous findings regarding the motivational and informational effects of rewards, we use social identity theory to predict that different types of inventors react differently to such false positive and false negative information. Specifically, we hypothesize that PFP that produces false positives has detrimental effects on corporate inventors with a taste for science, who are motivated by scientific prestige, reputation, and intellectual curiosity. The empirical results from survey data related to 3,995 inventor\u2013patent pairs show that, for this particular group of inventors, false positives are associated with reduced effort in research activities and fewer interactions with peers in the R&D department.

Based on strategic human resource management research, we introduce contingency theory to examine whether external (industry characteristics) and internal (prior firm performance and collective turnover) environments affect the use of selection practices, how the adoption of selection practices relates to subsequent firm performance, and whether the external (industry) and internal (selection stages and collective turnover) environments moderate the selection\u2013performance relationship. Using a sample of 413 firms, we found that firms use more selection practices when there is less collective turnover and when firms are within low-growth and stable industries. The results also show that firms employing more selection practices generated greater productivity but not profit. Positive effects occur when firms have less collective turnover and are within dynamic industries but, surprisingly, the effects of selection on performance can actually be negative in stable industries.

We integrate this theory with social information processing theory to develop hypotheses about the effects of a leader\u2019s sense of humor on follower behavior. We suggest that although a leader\u2019s sense of humor is positively associated with leader\u2212member exchange and ultimately work engagement, it can also signal to followers the acceptability of norm violation at work. These perceptions in turn are positively associated with followers\u2019 deviance. Furthermore, we propose that these indirect effects are moderated by leader aggressive humor.

We complement this line of work by exploring how scandals durably affect competition within a field, translating into relative advantages for certain organizations over others. First, scandals may benefit organizations that provide a close substitute to the offerings of the implicated organization. Second, scandals pave the way for moralizing discourses and practices, shake taken-for-granted assumptions about the conduct of organizations, and result in a shift in criteria used to evaluate organizations within the field. Our arguments suggest that organizations whose offerings are most similar to those of the implicated organization, yet are perceived as enforcing stricter standards of conduct, are likely to benefit the most from a scandal. We find support for these arguments in a county-level study of membership in the Catholic Church and 16 other Christian denominations in the United States in the wake of a series of sex abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic clergy between 1971 and 2000.

We propose that disasters that are attributed to other community members weaken cooperation and reduce the formation of new cooperatives that serve the community, unlike disasters attributed to chance or to nature, which strengthen cooperation and increase the creation of cooperatives. We analyze the Spanish Flu, a contagious disease that was attributed to infected individuals, and compare it with spring frost, which damaged crops and was attributed to nature. Our measure of resilience is whether the community members could form retail cooperatives\u2014non-profit community organizations.

While these concerns could be examined within each of their own independent literatures, existing theories are ill equipped to handle this process in tandem. Thus, studying these collaborations provides an opportunity to more broadly explore how organizations balance knowledge search or exploration efforts with their needs to manage organizational legitimacy. Accordingly, I suggest that collaboration facilitates access to external information, and that organizations pursue it when the information is needed to solve related problems. However, I also argue that collaborations reciprocally allow stakeholders to more directly scrutinize organizational practices. Thus, I predict that organizations suppress their use of collaborations to solve problems when their legitimacy is potentially or already at risk, such as when powerful stakeholders can hold an organization accountable for inappropriate acts or when some organizational actions have already been deemed as controversial.

While current literature assumes these value propositions can be known ex ante and an appropriate ecosystem design derived from them, we focus on generative technological innovations that enable an unbounded range of potential value propositions, hence offering no clear guidance to firms. To illustrate our arguments, we inductively study two organizations, each attempting to create two novel ecosystems around new technological enablers deep in their industry architecture. We highlight how ecosystem creation in such conditions is a systemic process driven by coupled feedback loops, which organizations must try to control dynamically: firms first make the switch to creating the ecosystem, following an external pull to narrow down the range of potential applications; then need to learn to keep up with ecosystem dynamics by roadmapping and preempting, while simultaneously enacting resonance. Dynamic control further entails counteracting the drifting away of the nascent ecosystem from the firm\u2019s idea of future value creation and the sliding of its intended control points for value capture. Our findings shed new light on strategy and control in emerging ecosystems, and provide guidance to managers on playing the ecosystem game.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0869","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['innovation', 'ecosystem', 'value propositions']","The article primarily focuses on innovation ecosystems and value creation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

To explore this possibility, we conducted an experimental experience sampling study with a sample of managerial employees whom we surveyed for 10 consecutive workdays.

We conduct a qualitative comparative case study of all CEO successions that involved female successors between 1989 and 2009 across the largest corporations in the United States. Our findings suggest that women\u2019s success occurred when a confluence of local firm-level factors and attributes of the (mostly) male predecessors promoted gender-inclusive gatekeeping during succession.

Specifically, we predict that employees are more likely to see the acceptance of a referral from a higher- (as opposed to a lower-) power referrer as a way for the hiring manager to gain more power in the relationship with the referrer, thereby attributing more self-interested motives and more counter-organizational motives to the hiring manager in such situations. These motives are then associated with harsher moral judgments of the hiring manager, which in turn lead to less support for the hiring decision.

A firm\u2019s board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information.

Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing.

We advance work\u2013family research by integrating balance theory with the interrole conflict literature to investigate dyadic interrole conflict congruence and challenge the implicit assumption that less interrole conflict always results in superior outcomes. Using a polynomial regression analysis of 141 employee and romantic partner dyads, we demonstrate that congruence between couples\u2019 experiences of family-to-work (but not work-to-family) conflict is positively associated with balance satisfaction, and ultimately employee job satisfaction and partner relationship satisfaction. Thus, when it comes to balance satisfaction and its downstream correlates, the harmful effects of high family-to-work conflict (FWC) are largely mitigated if an employee\u2019s partner shares a similarly high level of FWC, and the beneficial effects of low FWC are largely eliminated if an employee\u2019s partner does not share a similarly low level of FWC.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2016.0395","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['interrole conflict', 'employee outcomes', 'work-family']","The article discusses interrole conflict and its impact on employee and partner outcomes, touching on themes of work-life balance and employee well-being.

Higher investments, lower dividend payout, and higher risk tolerance indicate that family firms are better financial stewards of their companies than nonfamily firms. However, family firms are worse organizational stewards than nonfamily firms: they offer lower compensation, invest less in employee training, and exhibit higher voluntary turnover and lower labor productivity. Further, and contrary to earlier research, we find that financial practices in private family firms do not change over time, and that the deleterious influence of family on employment practices rises with both firm age and with heightened family involvement.

Drawing upon regulatory focus theory, we propose that the gap originates with a gender bias in the questions that investors pose to entrepreneurs. A field study conducted on question-and-answer interactions at TechCrunch Disrupt New York City during 2010 through 2016 reveals that investors tend to ask male entrepreneurs promotion-focused questions and female entrepreneurs prevention-focused questions, and that entrepreneurs tend to respond with matching regulatory focus. This distinction in the regulatory focus of investor questions and entrepreneur responses results in divergent funding outcomes for entrepreneurs whereby those asked promotion-focused questions raise significantly higher amounts of funding than those asked prevention-focused questions. We demonstrate that every additional prevention-focused question significantly hinders the entrepreneur\u2019s ability to raise capital, fully mediating gender\u2019s effect on funding. By experimentally testing an intervention, we find that entrepreneurs can significantly increase funding for their startups when responding to prevention-focused questions with promotion-focused answers.

Study 3 demonstrates that the negative effects of anger expressed toward competence-based violations are exacerbated, and positive effects of anger expressed toward integrity-based violations weakened, when a leader is perceived as abusive. These findings help reconcile divergent perspectives on the effects of leader anger expression, suggesting that anger can enhance perceived leader effectiveness when expressed in the right situation and by the right person.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0460","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['anger', 'integrity', 'abusive supervision']","The article discusses the impact of leader anger in contexts of integrity and abusive supervision, which touches on ethical leadership and emotional dynamics in organizations.

Simmelian brokers are trusted by their friends if they exhibit a role-appropriate diplomatic personality style involving flexibility of self-presentation (high self-monitoring) and inhibition of verbal loquaciousness (low blirtatiousness). Of course, not everyone engages in Simmelian brokerage. Some individuals experience a strongly cohesive situation\u2014i.e., a single friendship clique within which they are embedded.

Core theories of intergroup conflict suggest that such interteam resource conflicts unite teams internally, reducing intrateam power struggles. However, conflict spillover theory suggests that interteam conflicts may also stimulate competitive power dynamics within teams. We reconcile these two opposing lines of thought by introducing the internal power structure of teams as the key moderator that determines whether interteam conflict reduces or promotes power struggles within teams. We theorize that while the common fate of members of egalitarian teams makes them likely to unite and pool resources when facing an interteam conflict, the power differences in hierarchical teams cause members to be differently impacted by the resource-threatening interteam conflict, leading them to have different perspectives and concerns, thereby promoting internal fights over resources (i.e., power struggles). In turn, such power struggles are expected to negatively affect team performance. We tested these hypotheses with a laboratory study of 85 three-person negotiation teams and a field study of 158 organizational work teams, and found, as expected, that a resource-threatening interteam conflict promotes performance-detracting power struggles in hierarchical (but not egalitarian) teams.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2016.0182","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['power struggles', 'egalitarian', 'hierarchical']","The article discusses power dynamics within teams, particularly contrasting egalitarian and hierarchical structures, which touches on themes of equity and power distribution.

The behavioral agency model predicts that loss-averse family firms discount their shares more than nonfamily firms to minimize losses of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Conversely, the endowment effect in prospect theory suggests that family owners maximize their financial wealth (FW) by including SEW in perceptions of firm value and demanding a higher IPO price to relinquish it. We reconcile these seemingly incompatible predictions by examining dynamic properties of the reference point in decision framing. Conceiving IPO pricing as a two-stage gamble, we theorize that initial SEW losses entailed by the listing decision increase the disposition of family owners to underprice IPO shares to possibly offset these losses, or \u201cbreak even.\u201d We thereby advance the behavioral agency model with the aversion to loss realization logic to explain how family owners\u2019 decision frames and preferences change during the IPO process, depending on initial losses of current SEW and new expectations of future SEW.

Both public and private actors have attempted to promote such standards; however, we know little about the relative efficacy of such efforts.

In this study, we theorize and test how regional institutional logics filter the efficacy of public and private efforts to promote adoption of standards. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to policy, private actors such as social movement organizations, market intermediaries, and environmental entrepreneurs play a role in bolstering adoption. Yet, the efficacy of such interventions is dependent upon variations in regional culture; only environmental entrepreneurs were able to bridge the cultural divide and be equally effective in regions dominated by either market or community logics.

Drawing from literatures on multiteam systems, diversity, and risk we posit and show that divergent (vs. convergent) preferences for risk have positive implications for multiteam system behavior and performance. Specifically, when the leadership and component teams hold divergent risk preferences, multiteam systems engage in more aspirational behavior and perform better.

The signal instills confidence in the value of the partnership for skeptical licensee firms, and experienced licensing managers can amplify signals as needed to overcome the uncertainties inherent in technology commercialization. By explicitly addressing these variations in signal strength, we develop new theory that builds on classical signaling principles.

We propose that female leaders are less likely than male leaders to capitalize on these benefits of delegating. Although delegation has communal (e.g., relational) and agentic (e.g., assertive) properties, we argue that female leaders, as compared to male leaders, find it more difficult to delegate tasks due to gender-role incongruence. In five studies, we draw upon social role and backlash theories to show that women imbue delegation with more agentic traits, have more negative associations with delegating, and feel greater guilt about delegating than men. These associations result in women delegating less than men and, when they do delegate, having lower-quality interactions with subordinates.

Specifically, the investigation offers new knowledge of how organizational identity processes can shape whether decision-makers will resist versus give in to environmental pressures. Building on the notion that organizational identity acts as a filter through which decision-makers relate to the external environment, I develop the theoretical argument that strong organizational identification increases resistance to environmental pressures due to two mechanisms: (1) it bolsters the decision-maker\u2019s certainty and (2) it deflects the decision-maker\u2019s attention from the environment. A series of laboratory experiments not only test the mediated relationship between organizational identification and resistance to environmental pressures but also contrast different types of organizational identity. The empirical results support the hypothesized positive link between organizational identification and resistance, which becomes particularly strong when the organizational identity is normative (vs. utilitarian). The findings reported here enrich institutional theory by adding microfoundations to organizational practice adoption decisions and shedding new light on relevant enabling conditions for agency and within-field heterogeneity.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2016.0762","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['environmental pressures', 'organizational identity', 'agency']","The article discusses organizational responses to environmental pressures, which hints at a broader concern for sustainability and ethical organizational practices.

We suggest that the entrained rhythms featured in social entrainment theory act as a dual-edged sword with the potential to generate complacency detriments in addition to the commonly cited synchronization benefits. We argue that the manifestation and influence of the countervailing forces (i.e., synchronization and complacency) on the STTS experience\u2014team effectiveness relationship will depend on salient task characteristics (i.e., frequency and difficulty). More specifically, frequently performed tasks create conditions for complacency to manifest (generating an inverted-U shaped relationship between STTS experience\u2014team efficiency), whereas infrequently performed tasks do not (generating a positive, linear relationship). We further this distinction by layering on task difficulty that, we posit, acts to amplify the respective negative and positive consequences.

However, existing studies have primarily focused on the macro-level human resource management architecture, limiting our understanding about the cross-level origin of innovation. Developing an emergence-based human resource management framework, we propose that an employee-experienced high-involvement work system (HIWS) promotes innovation by eliciting collective interactions for knowledge exchange and aggregation. Further, we investigate the emergence-enabling process that facilitates an employee-experienced HIWS to give rise to organization-level innovation. Specifically, we probe three distinct emergence enablers that amplify the positive influence of HIWS on innovation by shaping the concertedness, direction, and adaptability of collective interactions: (1) the homogeneity of HIWS experiences as the internal mechanism, (2) the strategic importance of innovation as the external mechanism, and (3) the churn in human resources as the temporal mechanism. We tested our theoretical model using data from a nationally representative sample of workplaces in Canada (n = 2,639). Our results suggest that an employee-experienced HIWS was positively related to innovation.

Yet research has demonstrated that most leaders do not craft visions with image-based rhetoric, instead favoring abstract language that cannot easily be visualized. We integrate theory on leadership and dual cognitive processing to argue that this problem is exacerbated when leaders focus on word selection when crafting visions because they overemphasize the meaning-based cognitive system (in which they consider the abstract meaning of words) and underemphasize the experience-based cognitive system (in which they can generate vivid mental images of what the future could look like). We introduce a novel tactic to help leaders activate the experience-based system and, in turn, generate and communicate more impactful visions. We also investigate boundary conditions. We test our predictions with three experiments featuring three distinct samples, including one with senior corporate executives and one in which members of the British government crafted visions on the day Britain announced it would exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d).","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0375","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['leadership', 'vision', 'communication']","The article focuses primarily on leadership communication strategies without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Through a longitudinal study of photography firms transitioning from analog to digital technologies, we examine a key source of heterogeneity: whether and how incumbents integrate knowledge related to both old and new technologies to bridge generations. Specifically, we explore how the use of three types of intergenerational knowledge bridges\u2014(1) inventor bridges, (2) technology bridges, and (3) hybrid product bridges\u2014influences inventive performance in the new generation. Consistent with theories of inertia, we find that, on average, inventor and technology bridges are associated with lower performance in the new generation. However, the strength of a firm\u2019s inventive performance in the old generation positively moderates this effect. When performance in the old technology is strong, both technology and hybrid product bridges are associated with higher inventive performance in the new generation. This finding suggests that, when combined with a strong R&D program, old-technology knowledge forms a foundation that incumbents can leverage to learn new technologies as they navigate transitions.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2015.0690","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['transitions', 'knowledge', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on technological transitions and performance metrics without a clear emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, we posit that advice given from a brokerage position contains more nonredundant content that boosts recipients\u2019 creativity. Further, we expect advice brokerage to positively influence a giver\u2019s own creativity, though this effect is at least partially explained via recipients\u2019 proximal creativity gains (e.g., recipients\u2019 creativity change mediates the relationship). Recipients\u2019 perceptions of psychological safety accentuate these relationships.

Unfortunately, prior research on feedback valence and creativity is limited to the individual level, neglecting team creativity\u2019s interdependent and knowledge-intensive nature. We address this issue and advance the team-information-processing perspective on team creativity by integrating two heretofore separate research streams to develop a team-specific model about how negative and positive feedback enhance creativity via two alternative information processing routes, contingent on teams\u2019 informational diversity. Negative feedback fuels teams\u2019 systematic effort and attention to external, novel information. In informationally diverse teams, in which members hold different information and perspectives, these efforts promote team creativity through information elaboration. Conversely, positive feedback propels members to flexibly use their information and contribute the resultant divergent insights to the team. In informationally homogeneous teams, wherein these insights relate to others\u2019 information and perspectives, these divergent insights trigger teams\u2019 generative processing and in turn creativity.

We argue that the latter represent exogenous indices that affect evaluators in two opposing ways: they positively influence peer valuation by pointing to candidates\u2019 unobservable abilities, yet, since they are conferred by an external audience, they are also indicative of candidates\u2019 deviation from an expected peer identity. The combination of the two opposite effects suggests an inverted U-shaped relationship between exogenous indices and peer valuation.

By tracking the movements of over 40,000 investment professionals in the U.S. private equity industry over 10 years, we investigate the consequences of the ideological misfit that arises when individuals\u2019 political ideologies diverge substantially from the prevailing ideology of their firms. We hypothesize that ideological misfit increases the likelihood of departure, though the effects vary with liberal or conservative ideological orientation. Polynomial regression analyses reveal that the fit relationship between individual and organizational political ideology deviates from the idealized congruence relationship that underlies prevailing theory. Specifically, we find that departure is more likely for employees experiencing conservative misfit (a personal ideology more conservative than the firm\u2019s) versus liberal misfit (a personal ideology more liberal than the firm\u2019s). Conservatives are more likely to depart than liberals regardless of fit, and departing misfits tend to join new organizations that are closer to their own ideology.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2016.0817","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['political ideology', 'employee departure', 'ideological misfit']","The article explores the impact of political ideology on employee departure, indicating a moderate engagement with social themes related to workplace dynamics and individual identity.

To advance understanding of this process, I conducted an inductive study of temporary teams in four hospital emergency departments (EDs), and found that the teams in two EDs coordinated effectively, but the teams in the other two EDs did not. To theorize an explanation, I draw on the organizational justice literature and introduce the idea of justice enforceability, defined as the perception that authorities can act fairly, given the potential for other people to cheat. The team members\u2019 perceptions of justice enforceability were focused on whether the distribution of work within and between teams was fair or could be cheated. When team members perceived that justice was enforceable, they were willing to engage in the extra-role behaviors that wove together their individual responsibilities. But when they perceived that cheating was possible, they avoided the extra-role behaviors that would have made them suckers for working hard while others cheated. Justice enforceability thus resolves a common tension in temporary teams, namely that the potential for uneven effort can undermine team coordination. In these ED teams, members only trusted that authorities could act fairly when the distribution of work was exactly equal; then team members felt they were all \u201cin it together,\u201d and each put in the work to coordinate as a team.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2016.1101","articles","AMJ","Management & Organizations","6","['equity', 'justice', 'fairness', 'team coordination']","The article discusses themes of equity and justice within team dynamics, emphasizing fairness in work distribution and the perception of authority's ability to enforce justice.

The path to dysfunction involves escape though cognitive deconstruction. Regulatory focus is important in distinguishing between those who engage in identity play to generate possible new positive identities (i.e., promotion focus) and those who engage in cognitive dysfunction (i.e., prevention focus).

Unpacking the concept of executive symbolism and describing why executive actions carry symbolic significance, we primarily assess the \u201ctheme-aligned symbolic action\u201d\u2014an executive action undertaken with the intention of sending a message in support of some new theme. We draw from social influence theory to develop an integrated set of propositions for predicting members\u2019 reactions, or affective responses, to such actions. The predictive factors include attributes of the action itself, the reputation of the executive, and predispositions of respective members to the theme. As an outgrowth of this analysis, we conclude that theme-aligned symbols, no matter how artful, will almost always be ineffective in eliciting positive reactions from members who are antagonistic toward the theme. In turn, we introduce the concept of the \u201ctheme-muting symbol\u201d\u2014 a symbolic action intended to minimize the prominence or apparent implications of a new theme\u2014and we place this concept in the social influence framework as well.

We propose that firms seek to negotiate a shared social performance reference point with stakeholders who identify with the organization and care about social performance. While incentivized to align with the firm, firm-identified stakeholders provide intense feedback when there are major discrepancies between their expectations and the firm\u2019s actual social performance. Firms frame and respond to feedback differently depending on the feedback valence: negative feedback will be framed as a legitimacy threat, and firm responses are likely to be substantive; positive feedback will be framed as an efficiency threat, and firm responses are likely to be symbolic.

Extant theories of alliance instability provide incomplete answers, which is problematic: for stricken organizations, anticipating whether their nonstricken partners will remain in the alliance can be essential for survival. Integrating insights from the alliance dynamics literature and organizational stigma literature, we theorize about how an organization-specific adverse event affects a nonstricken partner\u2019s decision to continue with or defect from an alliance by considering factors that shift the balance between cohesive and disruptive forces. We propose that high stigmatization risk will increase the probability of partner defection through two disruptive mechanisms: relational uncertainty and stigma anxiety. Building on the idea that the same factors contributing to alliance formation may also condition partner defection, we theorize about the roles of partner resource interdependencies, relational embeddedness, and perceived partner similarity in amplifying or attenuating disruptive mechanisms triggered by an adverse event. We extend the research on partner defection and alliance instability by advancing an event-based view of alliance instability and specifying the conditions under which an alliance partner might defect.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2014.0323","articles","AMR","Management & Organizations","3","['stigmatization', 'relational uncertainty', 'partner defection']","The article discusses the impact of adverse events on organizational alliances, touching on themes of stigma and relational dynamics.

We challenge this assumption by theorizing about how adversity can create differential strain, affecting parts of an organization rather than the whole. We argue that relations among those parts fundamentally shape organizational resilience. We develop a theoretical model that maps how the differentiated emergence of strain in focal parts of an organization triggers the movements of adjoining parts to provide or withhold resources necessary for the focal parts to adapt effectively. Drawing on core principles of theories about intergroup relations, we theorize about three specific pathways\u2014integration, disavowal, and reclamation\u2014by which responses of adjoining parts to focal part strain shape organizational resilience. We further theorize about influences on whether and when adjoining parts are likely to select different pathways.

While research suggests performance benefits, an obvious question remains: If instrumental stakeholder theory\u2013based stakeholder treatment is so valuable, why isn\u2019t it the dominant mode of relating to stakeholders? We argue that the existing instrumental stakeholder theory literature has three shortcomings that limit its ability to explain variance in performance.

(2) The literature has largely neglected the potential downsides (i.e., costs) associated with pursuing these sorts of stakeholder relationships.

Largely absent in prior perspectives is a consideration of the relational dynamics and underlying behaviors by which individuals learn vicariously through interacting with others, rendering these perspectives less useful for understanding learning in the increasingly interconnected work of modern organizations. Integrating theories of experiential learning and symbolic interactionism, I offer a theoretical model of coactive vicarious learning, a relational process of coconstructed, interpersonal learning that occurs through discursive interactions between individuals at work. I explore how these interactions involve the mutual processing of another\u2019s experience; are influenced by characteristics of the individual, relational, and structural context in organizations; and lead to growth not only in individuals\u2019 knowledge but also in their individual and relational capacity for learning and applying knowledge.

Organizational blame shifting, which can take private as well as public forms, represents an organization\u2019s attempt to shape both the partner\u2019s and the public\u2019s sensemaking of the failure. Blame shifting enables an organization to limit its financial responsibility and contain potential reputational damage after failure. However, when organizations shift blame, they expose themselves to the risks of relationship dissolution and backlash from the public. We examine the cost-benefit analysis that drives organizational blame shifting, detail the failure-level and organization-level factors behind such decisions, and identify several outcomes of organizational blame shifting. This article contributes to the literature on interorganizational work relationships by shedding light on the mechanisms of organizational blame shifting.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2016.0305","special topic forum on the changing nature of work relationships","AMR","Management & Organizations","2","['blame shifting', 'organizational failure', 'reputational damage']","The article discusses organizational behavior in the context of blame shifting and reputational management, which touches on ethical considerations but lacks a strong focus on social justice or DEI themes.

This indicates a need to better understand how and when workplace friendships may lead to harmful outcomes, especially in light of organizational and technological shifts that are changing the way employees connect. Drawing on theories of close relationships, social exchange, and boundary management, we present a theoretical framework highlighting how four defining features of friendship (informality, voluntariness, communal norms, and socioemotional goals) are in tension with four fundamental elements of organizational life (formal roles, involuntary constraints, exchange norms, and instrumental goals). We also highlight how mutual self-disclosure and perceived similarity develop and deepen friendships but also lead to downsides for individuals, groups, and organizations. We articulate how specific features of a focal friendship clique (e.g., closeness, maturity, and status of members) may amplify or buffer negative aspects and how social media affect friendship formation and tensions. Our theoretical framework should inform new theory and research on positive relationships at work and boundary management of professional and personal identities, as well as how changes to work and technology affect workplace relationships.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2016.0309","special topic forum on the changing nature of work relationships","AMR","Management & Organizations","4","['workplace friendships', 'organizational outcomes', 'social exchange', 'boundary management']","The article explores the complexities and downsides of workplace friendships, indicating a consideration of social dynamics within organizational contexts.

To address the relational level, I conceptualize work relationships as a relational trajectory that captures the patterns of interrelating throughout the duration of the relationship.

Yet as the landscape of work shifts toward digitization of coordination processes, organizations increasingly rely on digitally mediated structured coordination to accomplish work, reducing opportunities for personal interactions. In this article we explore the interplay between employees\u2019 work relationships and differently structured coordination mechanisms to theorize about the role of relational coordination in coordination that is becoming increasingly structured owing to digitization. Specifically, we identify four categories of coordination mechanisms by leveraging two distinct components of a coordination mechanism\u2014actor selection and content delivery\u2014and recognizing that either component can be structured or unstructured. This granular categorization of coordination mechanisms allows us to delineate three causal routes by which relational coordination adds value to coordination enactment: informing actor selection, informing customization of content, and enabling shared interpretation. We complement prior research focusing on how, over time, coordination mechanisms influence the development of relational coordination by theorizing about how relational coordination enables the effective enactment of coordination mechanisms at a point in time. Our findings complement the understanding of the interplay between relational coordination and coordination mechanisms and can inform the design of coordination mechanisms in digitized work processes.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2016.0325","special topic forum on the changing nature of work relationships","AMR","Management & Organizations","3","['relational coordination', 'digitization', 'work relationships']","The article discusses relational coordination and its impact on work relationships in the context of digitization, which hints at social dynamics in organizational settings.

We leverage insights from self-categorization theory and relational coordination theory to explain different ways noncore role incumbents attempt to enact their noncore role identities. We then describe how the relational stances of those occupying core roles can enable or hinder the identity validation of those in noncore roles, and how validating the role-based identities of members in noncore roles fosters relational coordination at the group level while fostering positive identification with noncore roles. Finally, we theorize about how relational coordination facilitated by noncore role incumbents contributes to the relational climate of the organization, which subsequently motivates core role incumbents throughout the organization to support their teammates in noncore roles.","https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.2016.0333","special topic forum on the changing nature of work relationships","AMR","Management & Organizations","6","['identity', 'relational coordination', 'noncore roles', 'validation', 'organizational climate']","The article discusses the importance of identity validation for individuals in noncore roles, which aligns with themes of diversity and inclusion within organizational settings.

Using an automated topic-model analysis of historical texts associated with the U.S. amateur radio operator movement between 1899 and 1927, we propose a process model for lay-expertise legitimation as an alternative to professionalization. While the professionalization account depends on specialized work, credentialing, and restrictive jurisdictional control by powerful field actors, our model emphasizes four mechanisms leading to lay-expert recognition: building an advanced collective competence, operating in an unrestricted public space, providing transformational social contributions, and expanding an original collective role identity. Our analysis shows how field expertise can be achieved outside of professional spaces by non-professionalized actors who master activities as a labor of love. Our work also reveals that lay-expertise recognition depends on the interplay between collective identities and collective competence among non-professional actors, and it addresses the shifting power dynamics when professional and non-professional actors coexist and strive for expertise recognition.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839216686531","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['lay-expertise', 'social contributions', 'collective identity', 'power dynamics']","The article discusses the recognition of lay-expertise and the social contributions of non-professional actors, highlighting themes of collective identity and shifting power dynamics.

I argue that social relations between fraud victims and perpetrators insulate against the formation and diffusion of distrust. Variation in market participation after a fraud occurs because victims who belong to the perpetrator\u2019s social group are more likely to attribute blame to the organization that committed the fraud, while victims from social out-groups are more likely to generalize blame to the perpetrator\u2019s social group and subsequently avoid other organizations and institutions governed by its members. The empirical setting is Kenya\u2019s ethnically diverse Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), from which the country\u2019s largest stockbrokerage was expelled in 2008 after defrauding one-quarter of its 100,000 clients. Analysis of NSE data on trades for victimized and non-victimized investors, as well as surnames that identify investors\u2019 ethnicities, shows that clients from the same ethnic group as leaders of the corrupt brokerage are more likely than clients from rival ethnic groups to continue to participate in the market after a fraud and more likely to choose another intermediary operated by members of their ethnic group. But results also show that some victims invest more after the fraud and use less-trustworthy intermediaries to do so. This suggests that integrity-based trust may be a less effective coordination device in arm\u2019s-length market transactions than in interpersonal transactions. A key implication is that misconduct does not simply reduce average participation in a market; it changes the market\u2019s composition by filtering out diverse social groups that are more likely to demand stronger governance standards.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839217694359","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","6","['social relations', 'ethnic diversity', 'organizational misconduct', 'trust', 'governance']","The article discusses the impact of organizational misconduct on market participation, particularly through the lens of social relations and ethnic diversity.

Using a longitudinal panel of corporations that were members of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a prominent environmental certification, we show that in the face of reputational threats, organizations are less likely to publicize their certification status when the threat appears to directly contradict the claims implied by the certification. Our findings suggest that the threat of hypocrisy is amplified for firms with stronger reputations in the same domain as the certification and when audience members better understand and value the certification. Our findings delineate new boundary conditions under which firms will make prosocial claims and inspire reconsideration of long-held assumptions about the process of decoupling the implementation and communication of socially valued practices.

Using a longitudinal dataset of the investment decisions of limited partners investing in U.S. venture capital firms in the period 1997\u20132007, I find that an intermediary is less likely to facilitate a direct connection under two conditions: (1) the intermediary has experienced failed collaborations with one of the indirectly connected parties or (2) the intermediary has competitive concerns\u2014driven by its replaceability and relative attractiveness\u2014that it may lose future business to one of the indirectly connected parties.

We propose a theory of this evolution based on three nested and interacting processes. First, we identify several successive waves of technological revolution, each of which prompted a corresponding wave of change in the dominant organizational paradigm. Second, nested within these waves, each of these organizational paradigms emerged through two successive cycles\u2014a primary cycle that generated a new management model making the prior organizational paradigm obsolete, and a secondary cycle that generated another model that mitigated the dysfunctions of the primary cycle\u2019s model. Third, nested within each cycle is a problem-solving process in which each model\u2019s development passed through four main phases: (1) identification of a widespread organizational and management problem, (2) creation of innovative managerial concepts that offer various solutions to this problem, (3) emergence and theorization of a new model from among these concepts, and (4) dissemination and diffusion of this model. By linking new models\u2019 emergence to specific technological revolutions, we can explain changes in their contents. By integrating a dialectical account of the paired cycles with an account of the waves of paradigm change, we can see how apparently competing models are better understood as complementary pairs in a common paradigm.

Our analysis identified three types of regulatory actions (splicing, activating, and repressing) that participants took to flexibly enact these conflicting organizational goals through the same routine. We observed that the three regulatory actions facilitated new connections between new product development participants, allowing them to create a dynamic truce and accomplish the two conflicting goals in a new product\u2019s origination, evaluation, and development phases. Routine regulation shifts our focus away from the routine as a stable truce to the truce as process, highlighting the role of actions performed by individuals throughout the organizational hierarchy, and moves the conversation away from eliminating goal conflict to elaborating the ongoing actions that people take to manage conflicting organizational goals.

Because hubs access diverse knowledge and perspectives, they create positive externalities by providing novel ideas to their network neighbors. But hubs also generate negative externalities: extensive cross-community activity puts heavy demands on their attention and time, so that hubs may not provide strong commitment to their neighbors\u2019 projects. Because of this, network neighbors experience different externalities from hubs depending on their own formal role in projects. We use insights from our fieldwork in the French television game show industry to illustrate the mechanisms at play, and we test our theory with archival data on this industry from 1995 to 2012.

Moreover, we find that the acquisitive nature of extraverted CEOs reveals itself particularly in so-called \u201cweaker\u201d situations, in which CEOs enjoy considerable discretion to behave in ways akin to their personality traits.

Though many global institutional investors have declared their commitment to CSR principles, whether and how their investments actually improve local practices has yet to be examined. We hypothesize that changes implemented by local firms in response to pressure from global institutional investors are shaped by political dynamics among competing professional groups in organizations. Through interviews with CSR managers and consultants in Japan, we find that CSR managers push for gender diversity only in the upper ranks of their organizations. This helps managers limit resistance from human resources managers, who want to maintain the traditional employment system, while still gaining support from investor relations managers, who support changes that are visible to investors. Our findings from panel data analysis further document this change above the glass ceiling.

On some occasions, it causes employees to view their work as more meaningful. At other times, it causes them to become dispirited. These inconsistent findings may in part be explained by a paradox: the very features that make ultimate aspirations meaningful\u2014their breadth and timelessness\u2014undermine the ability of employees to see how their daily responsibilities are associated with them. To understand how leaders can help employees resolve this paradox, I analyzed archival evidence to explore the actions of President John F. Kennedy when leading NASA in the 1960s. I found that Kennedy enacted four sensegiving steps, each of which helped employees see a stronger connection between their work and NASA\u2019s ultimate aspirations. When this connection was strongest, employees construed their day-to-day work not as short-term tasks (\u201cI\u2019m building electrical circuits\u201d) but as the pursuit of NASA\u2019s long-term objective (\u201cI\u2019m putting a man on the moon\u201d) and the aspiration this objective symbolized (\u201cI\u2019m advancing science\u201d).

All commanders and providers faced goal and identity conflict and had access to similar integrative mechanisms. Yet only those associated with two brigades addressed these conflicts in ways that accomplished the army\u2019s superordinate goal of having both mission-ready and mentally healthy soldiers. Both successful brigades used what I call \u201canchored personalization\u201d practices, which included developing personalized relations across groups, anchoring members in their home group identity, and co-constructing integrative solutions to conflict. These practices were supported by an organizational structure in which professionals were assigned to work with specific members of the other group, while remaining embedded within their home group. In contrast, an organizational structure promoting only anchoring in one\u2019s home group identity led to failure when each group pursued its own goals at the expense of the other group\u2019s goals.

After the managers understood and accepted their renegotiated obligations, they changed how they administered resources and expectations in their groups, and the members of their respective groups adapted their practices in response.

Based on findings from ethnographic fieldwork, I hypothesize that the monetary value that individuals who identify with their work seek for their output depends on their audience: when they encounter discerning audiences, who are knowledgeable about and appreciative of their work, they underemphasize financial gains; transactions with non-discerning audiences, however, result in a focus on monetary rewards. I propose that the mechanism underlying this behavior is product attachment: people who identify with their work develop affection for the output of their labor and prefer to transact with audiences who will take care of their products beyond the point of sale, even if doing so results in lower monetary rewards. I substantiate this theory with a field experiment by demonstrating that handicraft artisans in India who identify with their work sell their products at different prices to discerning and non-discerning groups of buyers.

We compare two types of organizations, equipment manufacturing and film production, and find that although occupational control was important for emergent coordination in both settings, this relationship varied according to two aspects of occupational embeddedness: organizational acknowledgment of occupational control and occupational interdependence. In the equipment manufacturing setting, occupational control was latent: the communities visibly conformed to organizational control processes while exercising occupational control behind the scenes to coordinate emergently. In the film setting, the organization granted the occupational community significant latitude over its tasks, which enabled members to coordinate emergently to solve problems the majority of the time.

In both cases, gains and losses of status may occur without changes in actors\u2019 quality. Because audiences rely on status signals to infer the value of market actors, these exogenously generated status shifts can translate into changes in how audiences perceive actors, resulting in benefits for unearned status gains and costs for unearned status losses. We find support for our hypotheses in a sample of equity analysts at U.S. brokerage firms. Using data on the coveted Institutional Investor magazine All-Star award, we find that analysts whose status increases because of a category addition see corresponding increases in the stock market\u2019s response to their earnings estimates, while those who lose status see corresponding reductions.

That is, neighboring articles attract less attention when authors of papers near them receive a prestigious prize. This pattern reflects more than the trivial transfer of attention from non-winners to winners: once prizes are announced, actors cede scientific territory to prize winners and pursue other opportunities.

This study challenges the notion that consistency is the core of authenticity, demonstrating that for people with multiple valued identities, authenticity is not about being true to one identity across time and contexts, but instead involves creating and holding cognitive and social space for several true versions of oneself that may change over time.

Yet we know surprisingly little about the processes that facilitate the movement of workers across jobs within firms. I address this gap by first detailing the portfolio of internal hiring processes employed by large organizations, focusing on posting and slotting. Posting is a predominantly market-based process in which a manager posts an open job and invites interested candidates to apply, whereas slotting is a predominantly relational process in which a manager personally identifies a preferred candidate and \u201cslots\u201d him or her into an open job. I then examine how key differences between posting and slotting shape two outcomes of importance to firms and workers: quality of hire and compensation. My analysis of 8,107 internal hires at a large U.S. health-services firm reveals that outcomes for internal candidates depend, in part, on the nature of the process used to facilitate the movement from one job to the next; compared with slotted employees, workers who enter a job through posting have higher performance ratings, earn higher salaries, and are less likely to exit the firm. My findings suggest that the posting process improves the quality of hires by expanding the pool of potential candidates at the recruiting stage and by disciplining the information managers use to evaluate candidates at the selection stage. As well, internal candidates hired through posting are more likely to initiate salary negotiations and negotiate more competitively, resulting in higher initial salaries.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839217736045","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","5","['hiring processes', 'quality of hire', 'compensation', 'internal candidates']","The article discusses internal hiring processes and their impact on quality of hire and compensation, which touches on themes of equity in employment practices.

I explain this shift by showing how an increase in resources enticed peripheral communities (service providers, entrepreneurs, and scientists) to claim membership in the field. Such claims created a self-reinforcing cycle\u2014some peripheral communities enlarged the symbolic boundary of the field to grow the field, but this social and symbolic expansion threatened the identity of core communities and their ability to access resources. Core communities thus attempted to restrict the symbolic boundary and use this narrow definition to police membership claims by peripheral communities aiming to access the field\u2019s resources. I develop a theoretical model of how debate over a field\u2019s identity and resources shapes its social and symbolic boundaries.

Companies depend on brokerage firms to gain access to external resources, as a brokerage firm\u2019s coverage is a valuable form of recognition that may lower a company\u2019s cost of capital and increase its value. Yet path dependencies in a brokerage firm\u2019s evaluation routines may make it less likely to cover a company whose inventive activities build on different knowledge than it used in the past. Using data on 183 U.S. publicly traded medical device companies from 1993 to 2006, we examine how a company\u2019s use of new knowledge affects a brokerage firm\u2019s decision to cover the company. Our results suggest that a company may face a tension between exploration and resource dependence, as after it overcomes internal path dependencies that hinder exploration and successfully uses new knowledge, it may still fail to gain the attention of outside organizations on which it depends to access relevant resources due to externally borne path dependencies in the routines these outside organizations use to evaluate novelty. Also, in contrast with existing literature suggesting that brokerage firms have homogenous expectations for which strategies are appropriate for different types of companies, our results highlight that brokerage firms differ in how they respond to companies\u2019 inventive activities based on factors such as their prior exposure to new knowledge, prior evaluation of the companies\u2019 downstream product markets, and scope of technological expertise.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839217747269","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['evaluation routines', 'new knowledge', 'resource dependence']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of brokerage firms and their evaluation processes, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

R&D professionals are known for keeping their knowledge work within clearly defined boundaries, protecting it from individuals outside those boundaries, and rejecting meritorious innovation that is created outside disciplinary boundaries. The open innovation model challenges these boundaries and opens the knowledge work to be conducted by anyone who chooses to contribute. At NASA, the open model led to a scientific breakthrough at unprecedented speed using unusually limited resources; yet it challenged not only the knowledge-work boundaries but also the professional identity of the R&D professionals. This led to divergent reactions from R&D professionals, as adopting the open model required them to go through a multifaceted transformation. Only R&D professionals who underwent identity refocusing work dismantled their boundaries, truly adopting the knowledge from outside and sharing their internal knowledge. Others who did not go through that identity work failed to incorporate the solutions the open model produced. Adopting open innovation without a change in R&D professionals\u2019 identity resulted in no real change in the R&D process.

However, some studies in strategy and information systems have suggested that long-term abnormal returns may be a more appropriate measure of the value of IT events. To reconcile these streams of research, we develop and test an exploratory framework involving the maturity and scope of an IT event to assess the suitability of short-versus long-term abnormal returns. We conceptualize event maturity in terms of diffusion of the technology or phenomenon, and scope as the extent of complementary organizational changes that need to be implemented and managed. We posit that because of lack of widespread knowledge of best practices and cases of success and failure in a period of low technological maturity, the market may find it difficult to price such an event completely during the announcement period. Similarly, the challenge of acquiring and interpreting information on a firm\u2019s capability to manage wide scope of change may be an impediment to pricing high-scope events. We test our framework using a sample of 642 large outsourcing contracts and 1,700 electronic commerce initiatives. We empirically demonstrate that announcement period returns are indeed a complete measure of event value for cases characterized by high maturity and low scope; however, long-term abnormal returns are realized for events involving low maturity and/or high scope, which questions the validity of announcement period returns. Our results are robust to alternate model specifications. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice, and directions for future research.

We develop an analytical model to study the effect of different purchase options by strategic consumers on a firm\u2019s profit and the firm\u2019s strategies for the timing and pricing of its successive generations of product diffusion. We show that consumers\u2019 strategic behavior, although adversely affecting the sales of the first-generation product, positively influences the sales of the second-generation product through an initial \u201cseeding\u201d effect. The influence of strategic consumers on profit and sales depends largely on the discount-to-price ratio of the first generation relative to the performance improvement in the second generation. When the relative discount is small, the seeding effect on the second-generation product dominates. When the relative discount is large, the \u201ccannibalization\u201d effect on the first-generation product dominates. We further demonstrate that the optimal entry timings recommended in the literature (i.e., \u201cnow,\u201d \u201cmaturity,\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d) can occur under different market conditions. In general, higher performance improvement and lower salvage value would support a higher optimal price, a larger discount, and a later introduction time. In addition, the firm can benefit from patient consumers when the performance improvement is relatively small, and it can induce the complete substitution of the later generation for the earlier generation when the performance improvement is relatively large. Overall, our model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the effect of consumer strategic behavior on product diffusion, and our results offer important insights about firms\u2019 multigeneration product diffusion strategies.

Research from cognitive psychology has shown that it is possible to manipulate nonconscious cognition and behavior through \u201cpriming,\u201d a well-known phenomenon in which words and images are used to activate desired concepts in participants\u2019 minds. Our goal in this was to investigate whether priming during the task execution (called contextual priming) using 3D objects in the VE can improve brainstorming performance. To investigate this, we conducted two studies. The first used priming objects specifically related to the task topic and the second used priming objects related to creativity, in general. Compared to VEs without 3D priming objects, our results show that when groups brainstormed in the VEs designed with 3D priming objects, they generated better quality ideas as well as a greater breadth and depth of ideas. Thus, the 3D priming stimuli incorporated in a VE enhances brainstorming, which indicates that the design of VE has a direct effect on team brainstorming performance. Our results also show that target concept activation and task absorption act as the underlying mechanisms, partially mediating the relationship between the design of the VE (i.e., the presence or absence of priming objects) and performance outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0721","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['collaboration', 'creativity', 'brainstorming']","The article discusses the design of virtual environments to enhance group ideation, which touches on collaboration and creativity but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

We consider a marketing department that is responsible for choosing the level of advertising to generate traffic to the firm\u2019s website and an IT department that is responsible for choosing IT capacity to provide web visitors a satisfactory experience. The focus here is to examine how duopolistic advertising competition among firms can affect the organizational structure (centralized or decentralized) within each firm. In essence, our interest lies in the question: How does the presence of interfirm competition affect intra-firm coordination (i.e., organizational structure)? As a benchmark, we develop and solve a centralized decision model wherein the levels of advertising and IT capacity are jointly chosen in each firm to maximize profit. This is compared with a decentralized decision model in which the marketing department could potentially advertise suboptimally because its assessment of IT factors (the served traffic rate) is inaccurate. We find that competition can lead to a decentralized equilibrium in which both firms choose not to coordinate among their internal departments. More importantly, we find that when marketing moderately underestimates IT service quality, coordination results in a prisoners\u2019 dilemma (PD) equilibrium for each firm whereas decentralization is socially optimal but with an off-equilibrium outcome (resulting in higher profits for each firm). That is, the conventional wisdom that \u201cmore coordination is good\u201d could push firms toward a PD equilibrium when they can both be better off by not coordinating internally in the face of competition. This result also implies that if marketing tends to underestimate the capabilities of the IT department, it may be better to encourage such firms to coordinate less rather than encouraging them to coordinate more.

A number of scholars have sought to combine data mining with traditional econometric analyses. Typically, data mining methods are first used to generate new variables (e.g., text sentiment), which are added into subsequent econometric models as independent regressors. However, because prediction is almost always imperfect, variables generated from the first-stage data mining models inevitably contain measurement error or misclassification. These errors, if ignored, can introduce systematic biases into the second-stage econometric estimations and threaten the validity of statistical inference. In this commentary, we examine the nature of this bias, both analytically and empirically, and show that it can be severe even when data mining models exhibit relatively high performance. We then show that this bias becomes increasingly difficult to anticipate as the functional form of the measurement error or the specification of the econometric model grows more complex. We review several methods for error correction and focus on two simulation-based methods, SIMEX and MC-SIMEX, which can be easily parameterized using standard performance metrics from data mining models, such as error variance or the confusion matrix, and can be applied under a wide range of econometric specifications. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SIMEX and MC-SIMEX by simulations and subsequent application of the methods to econometric estimations employing variables mined from three real-world data sets related to travel, social networking, and crowdfunding campaign websites.

The increasing trend toward globalizing projects requires firms to coordinate development efforts made by team members from various functions within the firm, speaking multiple languages, and working in various time zones. We analyze qualitative data from 70 distributed product development projects that span 14 countries and involve cross-functional team members speaking 10 different languages. We find that commonly discussed integration strategies such as modular product designs and colocating team members by themselves are insufficient to coordinate project work. Rather, our field interviews suggest that firms invest in design information systems (DIS) with specific features to facilitate product design and empower their project managers to integrate the development efforts. Specifically, our interviews suggest that firms often modify the organization by \u201cunifying\u201d the engineering and purchasing functions into a single supply chain integrator function to increase the scope of responsibilities for these managers. We then test our hypotheses on the benefits of these strategies on project outcomes by using survey data from 55 distributed product development projects in 20 firms. Results indicate that the use of DIS is associated with higher quality and relationship performance when there are differences between focal and supplier firm personnel languages. Unifying engineering and purchasing functions into a supply chain integrator is associated with improved response time in the presence of time zone differences. We also find that a unifying strategy is associated with lower cost in the presence of language differences, but is also associated with a worsening of response time. These results provide guidance to product designers in organizations that must coordinate complex work across time zone barriers and languages. The results also provide guidance to researchers, by showing that different integration mechanisms may have differential effects across various coordination barriers and across multiple dimensions of project performance. We conclude by linking these results to integration mechanisms previously discussed in the coordination literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0733","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['integration', 'language barriers', 'cross-functional', 'coordination']","The article discusses challenges related to language barriers and cross-functional team dynamics, which touch on themes of inclusivity and coordination in diverse teams.

One particularly challenging human resource issue is that of work\u2013life conflict (WLC) of the IT professionals involved in GDSD, who routinely experience overlaps and conflicts between their work and personal life domains. While WLC concerns are relevant in almost any contemporary environment, the GDSD context adds several layers of challenges arising from issues such as time differences, requirements instability, and the use of certain systems development methodologies. Recent research indicates that WLC issues go beyond individual concerns and are of strategic importance for talent retention. To develop a deeper understanding of these recognized challenges, we utilize Border Theory as a metatheoretical framework to develop and empirically test a model of organization-related and GDSD-related antecedents of WLC. In addition, we examine the impacts of WLC on job-related outcomes. Our study adopts a mixed-methods design, where an exploratory case along with a review of the literature is used to develop the research model. The model is then tested using a survey of 1,000 GDSD workers in three countries.

We conducted a longitudinal exploratory case study of a multiyear EI implementation in a large logistics organization. Our analysis of the longitudinal data led us to identify three sets of boundary organization practices (i.e., organizing to negotiate, to contain, and to sustain).

In this study, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian learning model to examine the impact of social learning, through both targeted early adopter effects and general peer effects, and experiential learning on the information technology implementation process by physicians in a community health system. Our unique data allow us to disentangle the most common and challenging endogeneity issues associated with most social influence studies. We find that the experiential learning signal is more accurate than the social learning signals in the technology implementation process; and, between the two types of social learning signals studied here, targeted early adopter effects are much more informative than general peer effects. Furthermore, we experiment with several policy simulations to illustrate and quantify the two different types of social influence on this implementation process. The simulation results suggest that maintaining consistency in technology usage by targeted early adopters is more effective than increasing the frequency of their technology usage in reducing their colleagues\u2019 perceptions of uncertainty about the new technology. More specifically, we find that technology implementation probability would increase: (a) by 15%, on average, by adding a targeted early adopter to a group without early adopters; (b) by 25% by adding peer effects to solo users; and (c) by 47% by adding early adopter effects to solo users.

In response, a nonfocal firm can adapt its marketing strategy in consideration of these two opposing effects. Because social media is a flexible medium through which firms can quickly adjust marketing strategies in response to such unexpected events, we study how nonfocal firms adjust their post-crisis social media efforts to induce purchases and to improve customer relationships\u2014two strategies known in the literature as offensive and defensive marketing, respectively. In particular, we use the daily social media activities of 56 major airlines on Twitter around the time of the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash to study how nonfocal airlines ran offensive and defensive marketing on social media before and after the crisis. We find that, on average, nonfocal airlines increased their defensive marketing efforts but decreased their offensive marketing efforts after the crash, which we attribute to the negative spillover effect. However, the strategic adjustment of decreasing offensive marketing is attenuated by the competition between nonfocal airlines and the focal one, which we attribute to the moderating role of the competitive effect. These results are shown to be robust in various tests and reveal how the interplay of the two effects of a product-harm crisis on nonfocal firms shapes their postcrisis social media strategies.

Classic real options models fail to account for the value of proactive uncertainty-reducing mitigations, since they assume that uncertainty is fixed or follows a continuous, time-dependent dynamics. We present adaptations of these models that address this shortcoming. In our models, zero or more mitigations can be applied in varying sequences, mitigations have impulse-type effects on uncertainty reduction, and mitigations\u2019 effects can be complementary, substitutive, or synergetic. These traits make the value of mitigations path dependent and conditional on the uncertainty-reduction ability of earlier deployed mitigations. We operationalize the effects of mitigations in the IT and cybersecurity investment contexts. We also apply the adapted models to a real-world cybersecurity investment case from a Japanese company. Investments in multiple cybersecurity mitigations are typically treated as having a multiplicative effect that leads to overinvestment in mitigations. Our models avoid this problem, permitting to lower cybersecurity costs without compromising on loss prevention. More generally, our models allow implementing the real options logic more fully by supporting both passive and proactive IT investment risk management.

Practitioners and developers of original apps claim that copycats steal the original app\u2019s idea and potential demand, and have called for app platforms to take action against such copycats. Surprisingly, however, there has been little rigorous research analyzing whether and how copycats affect an original app\u2019s demand. The primary deterrent to such research is the lack of an objective way to identify whether an app is a copycat or an original. Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as natural language processing, latent semantic analysis, network-based clustering, and image analysis, we propose a method to identify apps as original or copycat and detect two types of copycats: deceptive and nondeceptive. Based on the detection results, we conduct an econometric analysis to determine the impact of copycat apps on the demand for the original apps on a sample of 10,100 action game apps by 5,141 developers that were released in the iOS App Store over five years. Our results indicate that the effect of a specific copycat on an original app\u2019s demand is determined by the quality and level of deceptiveness of the copycat. High-quality nondeceptive copycats negatively affect demand for the originals. By contrast, low-quality, deceptive copycats positively affect demand for the originals. Results indicate that in aggregate the impact of copycats on the demand of original mobile apps is statistically insignificant. Our study contributes to the growing literature on mobile app consumption by presenting a method to identify copycats and providing evidence of the impact of copycats on an original app\u2019s demand.

By providing an interorganizational information system (IOIS) and governance over use of this system and the information exchanged through it, HIEs enable more routine and efficient electronic sharing of patient information between disparate and fragmented healthcare providers. This should result in improved quality and efficiency of care. However, significant questions persist about the extent to which HIEs produce these benefits in practice, particularly in terms of reducing healthcare spending. We use transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize that HIEs establish a quasi-hierarchy that decreases frictions associated with information sharing in ways that reduce healthcare spending, and that the magnitude of reductions is greater when (1) insurer and provider incentives align, and (2) HIE capabilities mature. We can test these conjectures because HIEs, unlike other efforts that provide IOIS, are typically confined to regional markets and develop heterogeneously between these markets, introducing variation in insurer-provider incentive alignment and HIE maturity. Leveraging a unique national panel data set, we evaluate whether HIEs reduce spending for the largest insurer in the United States, i.e., Medicare, and whether incentives and HIE maturity modify the magnitude of reductions. We find significant spending reductions in healthcare markets that have established operational HIEs, with an average reduction of $139 per Medicare beneficiary per year (1.4% decrease) or a $3.12 billion annual reduction in spending if HIEs were nationally implemented in 2015. We also find that these reductions occur disproportionately in healthcare markets where providers have financial incentives to use an HIE to reduce spending and when HIEs are more mature. Our results inform an important open empirical question in the healthcare domain related to the value of HIEs, while also joining perspectives from TCE with the IOIS literature to understand the factors that may be relevant to IOIS value creation more generally.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0745","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['healthcare', 'information exchange', 'efficiency', 'spending reduction']","The article discusses healthcare efficiency and spending reduction, which are relevant to social welfare but primarily focus on economic outcomes rather than social justice or equity themes.

Peer influence can arise from immediate neighbors in the network (formally defined as cohesion or direct ties with one-hop neighbors) and from indirect peers who share common neighbors (formally defined as structural equivalence or indirect ties with two-hop neighbors). While the literature examined the role of each peer influence (direct or indirect) separately, the study of both peer network effects acting simultaneously was ignored, largely because of methodological constraints. This paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the simultaneous effect of both direct and indirect peer influences in technology adoption in the context of caller ringback tone (CRBT) in a cellular telephone network, using data from 200 million calls by 1.4 million users. Given that such a large-scale network makes traditional social network analysis intractable, we extract many densely connected and self-contained subpopulations from the network. We find a regularity in these subpopulations in that they consist either of about 200 nodes or about 500 nodes. Using these subpopulations and panel data, we analyze direct and indirect peer influences using a novel autoprobit model with multiple network terms (direct and indirect peer influence, with homophily as a control variable). Our identification strategy relies on a newly designed spatial autoregressive model, allowing us to identify the direct and indirect peer influences on each of the extracted subpopulations. We use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations. The results show CRBT adoption to be simultaneously determined by both direct and indirect peer influence (while controlling for homophily and centrality). Robustness checks show model fit to improve when both peer influences are included. The size and direction of the two peer influences, however, differ by group size. Interestingly, indirect peer influence (structural equivalence) plays a negative role in diffusion when group size is about 200, but a positive role when group size is about 500. The role of direct peer influence (cohesion), on the other hand, is always positive, irrespective of group size. Our findings imply that businesses must design different target strategies for large versus small groups: for large groups, businesses should focus on consumers with both multiple one-hop and two-hop neighbors; for small groups, businesses should only focus on consumers with multiple one-hop neighbors.

We propose a game-theoretic model that analytically conceptualizes the interplay among the degree of same-side platform openness, the absorptive capacity of the entrant, and the intensity of network effects. Our analysis uncovers interesting new results. First, when entrant product quality is exogenous, under very strong network effects, the incumbent closes the technology. Moreover, we discuss various interesting open-platform co-opetition outcomes that arise under a fully covered market. When the entrant chooses the quality level and the incumbent is strategic in its platform opening decision, we find that intense network effects make new players shun the market, so intellectual property (IP) sharing is not possible in equilibrium. When the network effects are of intermediate intensity, the incumbent opens the technology to the entrants who have a sufficiently high absorptive capacity, calibrating the amount of sharing to the entrant\u2019s absorptive capacity level to ensure that the duopoly setting is mutually beneficial. Our key findings and insights are robust to several model extensions, including scenarios when the incumbent is uncertain of the entrant\u2019s absorptive capacity, or when the entrant incurs a general non-linear development cost structure. We also compare and contrast bounded versus unbounded market scenarios. We further explore the ability of the incumbent to engineer the strength of network effects in the market and uncover non-trivial alternating-monotonicity patterns for the optimal intensity of network effects with respect to the entrant\u2019s absorptive capacity. We also show that a model with exogenous network effects could drastically underestimate the range of entrants\u2019 absorptive capacity values for which the incumbent should open its platform, causing the latter to miss valuable co-opetition opportunities.

Perceived wisdom suggests that multihoming is beneficial for complement providers as they expand their market reach, but it reduces differentiation among competing platforms as the same complements become available on different platforms. We argue that complement providers face trade-offs when designing their products for multiple platform architectures\u2014they must decide how far to specialize the complement to each platform\u2019s technological specifications. Because of these trade-offs, multihoming complements can have different quality performance across platforms. In a study of the U.S. video game industry, we find that multihoming games have lower-quality performance on a technologically more complex console than on a less complex one. Also, games designed for and released on a focal platform have lower-quality performance on platforms they are subsequently multihomed to. However, games that are released on the complex platform with a delay suffer a smaller drop in quality on complex platforms.

A platform owner can open access for third-party participants by establishing boundary resources, such as APIs and an app store, to allow complements to be developed and shared for the platform. Furthermore, to foster cooperation with the complementors, the platform owner can use an open-source license boundary resource to open and share the platform\u2019s core resources. However, openness that is too wide renders the platform and its shared resources vulnerable to strategic exploitation. To our knowledge, platform strategies that promote such negative outcomes have remained unexplored in past research. We identify and analyze a prominent form of strategic exploitation called platform forking in which a hostile firm, i.e., a forker, bypasses the host\u2019s controlling boundary resources and exploits the platform\u2019s shared resources, core and complements, to create a competing platform business. We investigate platform forking on Google\u2019s Android platform, a successful open digital platform, by analyzing the fate of five Android forks and related exploitative activities. We observe several strategies that illustrate alternative ways of bundling a platform fork from a set of host, forker, and other resources. We also scrutinize Google\u2019s responses, which modified Android\u2019s boundary resources to curb exploitation and retain control. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we present a theorization of the competitive advantage of open digital platforms and specifically expose platform forking as an exploitative and competitive platform strategy. Second, we extend platform governance literature by showing how boundary resources, which are mainly viewed as cooperative governance mechanisms, are also used to combat platform forking and thus sustain a platform\u2019s competitive advantage.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2018.0786","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['exploitation', 'open digital platforms', 'cooperation']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of digital platforms and competitive strategies, with limited engagement in social themes.

Despite heated debates on the behavior of platform owners toward complementors, relatively little is known about the mechanisms linking platform owners\u2019 entry and complementary innovation. We exploit Google\u2019s 2015 entry into the market for photography apps on its own Android platform as a quasi-experiment. We conclude based on our analyses of a time-series panel of 6,620 apps that Google\u2019s entry was associated with a substantial increase in complementary innovation. We estimate that the entry caused a 9.6% increase in the likelihood of major updates for apps affected by Google\u2019s entry, compared to similar but not affected apps. Further analyses suggest that Google\u2019s entry triggered complementary innovation because of the increased consumer attention for photography apps, instead of competitive \u201cracing\u201d or \u201cRed Queen\u201d effects. This attention spillover effect was particularly pronounced for larger and more diversified complementors.

Although extant literature offers important insights into platform management from a platform-owner perspective, we know little about how organizations manage industry platforms provided by external parties to generate opportunities and overcome challenges in relation to their infrastructure and work processes. As part of larger ecosystems, these digital platforms offer organizations bundles of digital options that they can selectively invest in over time. At the same time, organizations\u2019 previous investments in digital infrastructure and work processes produce a legacy of digital debt that conditions how they manage their digital platforms over time. Against this backdrop, we investigate how digital options and digital debt were implicated in a large Scandinavian media organization\u2019s management of a news production platform over nearly 17 years. Drawing on extant literature and the findings from this case, we theorize the progression of and interactions between digital options and digital debt during an organization\u2019s digital platform management in relation to its infrastructure and work processes. The theory reveals the complex choices that organizations face in such efforts: While they may have to resolve digital debt to make a platform\u2019s digital options actionable, hesitancy to plant digital debt may equally well prevent them from realizing otherwise attractive digital options. Similarly, while identified digital options may offer organizations new opportunities to resolve digital debt, eagerness to realize digital options may just as easily lead to unwise planting of digital debt.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2018.0788","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['digital platforms', 'infrastructure', 'work processes']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of digital platform management and does not address social justice, equity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

While the effect of the average of review ratings is straightforward, we focus on examining how the effect is moderated by the dispersion of review ratings and the discount threshold set for the group-buying deals. A comprehensive literature review suggests that a large rating dispersion can deliver two different messages to consumers (uncertainty in product quality and uniqueness of product taste) and thus may either positively or negatively moderate the effect of average rating on social media endorsement. Discount threshold may serve as a quality signal, reinforcing the effect of average rating.

Online platforms attract advertisers by offering capabilities to reach audiences likely to be receptive to their ads in a timely and accurate manner. However, the collection and processing of user information required for targeting of ads may lead to privacy concerns. We model the competition between two platforms as a two-stage game where platforms announce their targeting capabilities in the first stage and advertising fees in the second stage. The presence of heterogeneity in the user and the advertiser populations with respect to their preferences for targeting leads to differentiation between platforms. While one platform offers the minimum level of targeting feasible, the other platform offers a strictly higher level of targeting. The extent of differentiation in targeting levels depends on the intensity of competition between the platforms on the user side. When competition on the user side is relatively low, the extent of differentiation is higher. Such competition for users may decline, when users are less concerned about loss of privacy or when they choose to double home. Higher targeting differentiation allows platforms to charge higher advertising fees and earn higher profits. We also consider the case where platforms can reduce the privacy concerns of users by offering them greater control over their personal information. We demonstrate that awarding user control leads to reduced targeting differentiation between platforms and lower advertising fees. Last, we derive the equilibrium targeting levels for platforms that use a subscription-based business model instead of an advertising-based business model.

We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers\u2019 purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more \u201chelpful\u201d reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns\u2014after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model\u2014unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase.

While these mechanisms generally enable the content flow between senders and recipients, they vary in protecting users\u2019 social and institutional privacy on OSNs. Additionally, sharing mechanisms might differ with respect to their labeling (e.g., positive versus neutral), which might interact with the sharable content. We examined the effects of these three design aspects on users\u2019 sharing behavior in a controlled experiment and two analyses of observational data. The results show that two types of sharing mechanisms negatively affect content sharing in the domain of news sharing: those that allow greater information flow control over the sharing process and thus protect users\u2019 social privacy and those that employ two-click designs to preserve users\u2019 institutional privacy. These negative effects mainly stem from higher frictional costs associated with these features. For the average user in this domain, the disutility and additional cognitive effort generated by one additional click often mitigates the utility of sharing itself. Moreover, we find that neutral button labeling is important for fostering content sharing as users might encounter schema incongruity when using a positively connoted label to share bad news. Overall, a wrong decision in terms of the sharing mechanism can easily decrease the number of shares by up to 86%. Therefore, content providers can easily and substantially increase content sharing by properly designing the sharing mechanism on their websites.

Our model encompasses the benefits of posting information, positive externalities in the form of recognition and entertainment benefits due to others\u2019 sharing of information, and heterogeneous privacy preferences. We find that regulation of peer disclosure is necessary. We consider two candidate regulations, i.e., nudging and quotas. Nudging reduces user participation and privacy harm and sometimes improves social welfare. By contrast, imposing a quota often improves user participation, privacy protection, and social welfare. Adding a nudge on top of a quota does not bring additional benefits. We show that any regulation that uniformly controls the disclosure of sensitive and nonsensitive information will not serve the triple objectives of reducing privacy harm, increasing social welfare, and increasing information contribution.

In this paper, we examine whether latent personality traits of online users accentuate or attenuate the effectiveness of WOM in social media platforms. To answer this question, we leverage machine-learning methods in combination with econometric techniques utilizing a novel quasi-experiment. Our analysis yields two main results. First, there is a positive and statistically significant effect of the level of personality similarity between two social media users on the likelihood of a subsequent purchase from a recipient of a WOM message after exposure to the WOM message of the sender. In particular, exposure to WOM messages from similar users in terms of personality, rather than dissimilar users, increases the likelihood of a postpurchase by 47.58%. Second, there are statistically significant effects of specific pairwise combinations of personality characteristics of senders and recipients of WOM messages on the effectiveness of WOM. For instance, introverted users are responsive to WOM, in contrast to extroverted users. Besides this, agreeable, conscientious, and open social media users are more effective disseminators of WOM. In addition, WOM originating from users with low levels of emotional range affects similar users, whereas for high levels of emotional range, increased similarity usually has the opposite effect. The examined effects are also of significant economic importance, as, for instance, a WOM message from an extrovert user to an introvert peer increases the likelihood of a subsequent purchase by 71.28%. Our findings are robust to several alternative methods and specifications, such as controlling for latent user homophily and network structure roles based on deep-learning models. By extending the characteristics that have been theorized to affect the effectiveness of WOM from the observable to the latent space, tapping into users\u2019 latent personality characteristics, and illustrating how companies can leverage the abundance of unstructured data in social media, our paper provides actionable insights regarding the future potential of social media advertising and advanced microtargeting based on big data and deep learning.

Current explanations of IT-based regulation fit into received frameworks such as structuration theory, actor-network theory, or neoinstitutional analyses but fail to recognize the unique capacities IT and related IT-based regulatory practices offer as a powerful regulatory means. Any IT-based regulation system is made up of rules, practices, and IT artifacts and their relationships. We propose this trifecta as a promising lens to study IT-based regulation in that it sensitizes scholars into how IT artifacts mediate rules and constitute regulatory processes embracing rules, capacities of IT endowed by the artifact, and organizational practices. We review the concepts of rules and IT-based regulation and identify two gaps in the current research on organizational regulation: (1) the critical role of sensemaking as part of IT-based regulation, and (2) the challenge of temporally coupling rules and their enactment during IT-based regulation. To address these gaps we introduce the concept of regulatory episode as a unit of analysis for studying IT-based regulation. We also formulate a tentative research agenda for IT-based regulation that focuses on tensions triggered by the three key elements of the IT-based regulatory processes.

By tracking the sales of 19,978 deals on Groupon.com and conducting a battery of identification and falsification tests, we find that deep discounts reduce sales. A 1% increase in a deal\u2019s discount decreases sales by 0.035%\u20130.256%. If a merchant offers an additional 10% discount from the sample mean of 55.6%, sales could decrease by 0.63%\u20134.60%, or 0.80\u20135.24 units and $42\u2013$275 in revenue. This negative effect of discount is more prominent among credence goods and deals with low sales, and when the deals are offered in cities with higher income and better education. Our findings suggest that consumers are concerned about product quality, and excessive discounts may reduce sales immediately. A follow-up lab experiment provides further support to this quality-concern explanation. Furthermore, it suggests the existence of a \u201cthreshold\u201d effect: the negative effect on sales is present only when the discount is sufficiently high.

Text communication has been put forth as one solution to addressing this duality of team diversity. Unfortunately, the empirical results have been far from conclusive. We believe that resolving such inconsistencies is crucial to developing a more complete understanding of the use of communication technologies. To accomplish this, we developed a research model based on media synchronicity theory. We empirically tested this model by conducting a laboratory experiment with 46 teams, consisting primarily of men and women self-identified as Caucasians and Asians, performing a decision-making task. The results show that the type of diversity matters. Text communication improved knowledge sharing (i.e., conveyance) and knowledge integration (i.e., convergence) in racially diverse teams but impaired both in gender diverse teams.

We find that both the informativeness of the campaign and considerations related to gaining access to venture capital funding affect the entrepreneur\u2019s choice of campaign instruments, as well as her decision of whether to run a campaign. In particular, entrepreneurs should launch the campaign either when it is highly informative or when it is not informative at all. For relatively low levels of informativeness, but not so low that the venture capitalist (VC) completely ignores the campaign outcome in his funding decision, our study suggests that the entrepreneur might forgo the opportunity of acquiring information via crowdfunding because the benefits of crowdfunding are insufficient to offset the risk of campaign failure. We also find that the preference of entrepreneurs in favor of crowdfunding is stronger than that of VCs. For backers, we point out that in addition to the risk inherent in new product development, they should be cognizant of the risk that successful campaigns do not guarantee subsequent VC funding. As the use of crowdfunding platforms becomes more prevalent for entrepreneurial projects, our study offers a deeper understanding of the dual role of reward-based crowdfunding in terms of acquiring demand information and raising capital for early-stage start-ups.

Using highly disaggregated clickstream data in a difference-in-differences setting, we compare the web behavior of 20,000 consumers in Germany and three control countries. We find that this intervention was not very effective in reducing unlicensed consumption or encouraging licensed consumption, mainly because users quickly switch to alternative unlicensed sites. We highlight that the shutdown additionally had important unintended externalities. Individuals who never visited kino.to and who additionally clicked on news articles that covered the shutdown increased their visits to piracy websites substantially. We show that this effect largely comes from articles that explicitly mention alternative websites or suggest that users do not have to fear legal consequences from unlicensed streaming. Finally, we document that the unlicensed video streaming market is much more fragmented after the shutdown, potentially affecting future interventions, at least in the short run.

This fear is justified by the fact that once the customer has invested significant time and effort in co-designing a product, the firm can extract the entire consumer surplus through higher prices. At the same time, the firm allowing its customers to co-design products would be unlikely to commit to a price up front before knowing the complete design of the custom product, since it would then face a significant risk of losing money. In this paper, we develop analytical models for this problem, and show how a firm can motivate its customers to engage in co-design. We also show how offering co-design can impact the firm\u2019s product (line) strategies and the quality of its products, including motivating the firm to increase the quality of its standard product, sometimes even beyond the efficient quality level. The effect of market and firm characteristics on the value of engaging customers in the co-design process is also examined. In addition, we analyze the effects of (a) information asymmetry about the firm\u2019s co-design capability, and (b) competition, on the firm\u2019s decisions regarding co-design.

For givers, gifting can be an important means to enhance social relationships. On the other hand, for SNS providers, members\u2019 gifting can serve as a major source of revenue. As SNS providers continue to face challenges in generating revenues, understanding how to stimulate gifting through SNS can allow them to profit from members\u2019 relationships. However, there is little understanding of what drives members\u2019 gifting through SNS, with limited prior research on online gifting. Thus motivated, we develop a research model of the antecedents of SNS gifting that builds on social exchange theory and prior gifting literature, and incorporates the unique aspects of such gifting (that we refer to as microgifting, with low-price digital voucher gifts). The theoretical model was validated through a field study, in which both subjective and objective data were collected from an SNS that has been successful in offering such gifting services. Our findings highlight the effects of perceived worth, SNS gifting experience, and the number of SNS friends on the frequency of SNS gifting. The results also show that expected benefits (i.e., reciprocity, pleasure, relationship support, convenience, and immediacy of gift sending) and costs (i.e., impersonality) indirectly impact SNS gifting frequency through the assessment of perceived worth. The study contributes to research by adding to our understanding of this new approach of gifting through SNS, i.e., microgifting. It also lends insights on how SNS providers can offer such services to tap this source of revenue.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0737","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['gifting', 'social relationships', 'reciprocity']","The article primarily focuses on the economic aspects of gifting through social network services, with limited emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In this study, we examine the impact of online management responses on business performance and their spillover effect on nearby businesses. By adopting multiple causal identification strategies to address the issue of self-selected responses, we find that the responses by a business owner play a significant role in the performance of the focal business as well as in the performance of the nearby businesses. We observe that, in general, the launch of the new management response feature benefits businesses. What is more interesting is that the benefit is not observed in a consistent manner across all businesses. Only the businesses that choose to use the management response feature observe increases in check-ins. On the other hand, the businesses that are unaware of the management response feature launch on digital platforms, or are aware but choose not to use the management response feature, tend to remain at a disadvantage. Interestingly, we also uncover that the spillover effect (externality) of online management responses on the nearby businesses crucially depends on whether the focal business and the nearby businesses are in direct competition. Furthermore, we identify conditions under which business owners are more likely to respond to consumer comments.

Although the prior OLM literature predominantly found systematic advantages for IT service providers from developed countries because of their higher perceived quality, the reality is that most service providers in OLM are from developing countries. This phenomenon requires a robust analysis of how OLMs are evolving. In this study, we conduct a geo-economic analysis on IT service providers\u2019 survival utilizing a unique longitudinal panel data set from an OLM, which comprises 40,874 IT service providers from different countries over a period of more than four years (2006 to 2010).

Our findings provide a different perspective from the prior literature on OLM by showing a systematic advantage for IT service providers from developing countries in terms of survival, especially when providers from developing countries were able to signal their individual quality through reputation.

Specifically, professionals in IOCoPs are embedded in two different social environments: the virtual community where they interact with online peers and organizations where they utilize their knowledge. Therefore it is important to simultaneously study motivating factors generated from these two different contexts, including peer effects within and organizational influences outside the virtual community. In this research, we apply a novel econometric identification method to analyze a unique data set collected from a virtual IOCoP in the financial trading sector.

These firms have recently begun to compete on electronic markets by selling goods and services through local daily deal sites, such as Groupon and LivingSocial. We extract publicly available activity and spatial information from Groupon, LivingSocial, Google Maps, and Flickr to construct a unique panel data set to study daily deals offered by restaurants and spa vendors in geographical clusters of concentration in 167 distinct cities. This data set allows us to examine the effect of location on the competition vendors face in electronic markets. We find that as vendors in a particular geographical cluster participate in electronic markets, local competition increases and other vendors in that cluster join the electronic market and deepen discounts in response. However, vendors in other clusters in the same city remain relatively unaffected. We further analyze vendor ratings from Yelp and other infomediaries, to show that lesser known and low-quality vendors utilize the advertising effect of electronic markets to increase their awareness among customers. We further test the moderating effect of horizontal and vertical differentiation among firms in geographical clusters on competition in electronic markets, using measures extracted from UrbanSpoon.com. We find that clusters having lower differentiation experience higher competitive effects of firms joining the electronic market.

In this study, we address three key components of the SLA-based cloud resource management and pricing problem, from the service-provider\u2019s perspective: (1) availability-aware backup resource provisioning; (2) price-penalty schedule determination; and (3) penalty-deferred pricing over two periods. Using the convexity of the provider\u2019s expected total cost over the number of backup resources, we present a dichotomous search algorithm to derive the total cost minimizing number of backup resources for a given level of SLA-specified service availability guarantee. Next, we derive closed-form solutions for the lower bound of the feasible price range, yielding a schedule of breakeven price-penalty combinations, which establishes the baseline required in the economic modeling of the service contracts and related negotiation processes, and may also elicit client preference information. We then model a two-period pricing problem specifically designed to incentivize penalty deferrals in the event of an SLA violation. Detailed experimental studies of the proposed models have been carried out using real-world datacenter log data. The computational study validates the convexity of the probability density function of SLA violations over the number of backup resources. The results demonstrate significant interaction effects between the SLA parameters (price, penalty rate, and provisioning cost) and the backup resource provisioning decisions made by the provider, leading to key practical managerial implications for SLA design and resource deployment in the availability-aware cloud.

In particular, related literature shows that when consumers underestimate a product, it is often better for the manufacturer to offer a base version of the product along with the fully featured version. This is because the base version lets consumers discover their true valuations, allowing the manufacturer to set a high price for the full version. This finding is also consistent with broader literature in economics, which contends that informing consumers cannot be optimal unless doing so also improves their average willingness to pay. Absent any such upward revision, keeping consumers in the dark becomes profitwise equivalent to first-degree price discrimination. This equivalence, although correct, does not hold when a fraction of consumers are fully aware of the true valuation to begin with. Accordingly, we propose a new perspective and explain why a manufacturer should consider versioning even when consumers do not underestimate the product and their average willingness to pay does not change after exposure to it. The point of this paper is to show that the presence of an informed segment of consumers fundamentally changes the information structure of the market, elevating in the process the relative value of information dissemination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0763","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on economic theories related to consumer behavior and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although the effects of the average and the number of consumer ratings on future product pricing and demand have been studied with some conclusive results, the effects of the variance of these ratings are less well understood. We develop a model where we decompose the variance of consumer ratings into two sources: taste differences about search and experience attributes of a durable good, and quality differences among instances of this good in the form of product failure. We find that (i) optimal price increases and demand decreases in variance caused by taste differences, (ii) optimal price and demand decrease in variance caused by quality differences, and (iii) when holding the average rating as well as the total variance constant, for products with low total variance, both price and demand increase in the relative share of variance caused by taste differences. Counter to intuition, we demonstrate that risk-averse consumers may prefer a higher-priced product with a higher variance in ratings when deciding between two similar products with the same average rating.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0764","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer ratings and their impact on pricing and demand without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a model of an electronic marketplace in which two competing manufacturers sell their products through a common retail platform, we study the effect of recommender systems on the retail platform, manufacturers, consumer surplus, and social welfare. In our setting, consumers are differentiated with respect to their preference for the two products (locational differentiation) and awareness about the two products (informational differentiation). A recommender system selects the recommendation based on a recommendation score, which is a weighted sum of expected retailer profit and expected consumer value. We find that the recommender system may benefit or hurt the retailer and the manufacturers depending on the signs and magnitudes of the substitution effect and demand effect of the recommender system. The substitution effect of the recommender system either intensifies or softens the price competition between two manufacturers through two forces\u2014its direct influence alters the informational differentiation of consumers (which affects the markup that manufacturers can charge), and its strategic influence motivates the manufacturers to use price as a lever to attract more recommendations in their favor. The demand effect of the recommender system increases overall consumer awareness, but, depending on the substitution effect, may increase or decrease the demand. The recommendation strategy, namely, the relative weight assigned to retailer profit vis-\u00e1-vis consumer value in computing the recommendation score, along with recommender system precision and the relative sizes of segments of consumers with different awareness levels, determines whether the retailer benefits from the recommender system and by how much. We find that the retailer\u2019s optimal recommendation strategy is mildly profit oriented in the sense that it assigns a larger, but not too large, weight to retailer profit compared to consumer value, and that under the optimal strategy, the price competition is less intense and the retailer profit is higher compared to when there is no recommender system. Furthermore, an increase in either the recommender system precision or the fraction of consumers that are aware of at least one product induces the retailer to adopt a more profit-oriented recommendation strategy.

Despite their prevalence, linear anonymous prices do not necessarily correspond to Walrasian competitive equilibrium prices in such settings, and their impact is not well understood. This paper is the first to analyze the effect of different pricing rules on the efficiency of combinatorial exchanges, using both analytic methods and numerical experiments. Our analysis is motivated by a combinatorial fishery-rights exchange designed to reform the fishing industry in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We find that when linearity and anonymity are required for only one side of the market, the average efficiency loss is negligible. In contrast, with a single linear price vector for both sides, the efficiency loss is substantial, especially when the market is small. In a formal model, we show that efficiency losses decrease when the number of buyers grows or the size of the submitted packages decreases. Besides the reform of the NSW fishing industry, our results have important implications for other cap-and-trade programs as well as other industries where demand or cost complementarities play a role.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0766","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['equality', 'fair', 'reform']","The article discusses pricing mechanisms in the context of a fishery-rights exchange, which hints at themes of fairness and reform.

Constructing a novel firm-patent panel database from 29 countries, I find that transparency directly boosts innovative effort by reducing managerial career concerns.

We proxy for the standardization of covenants using the textual similarity of their contractual definitions. We find that securitized loans are associated with higher covenant standardization than nonsecuritized institutional loans. In addition, we show that CLOs with more diverse or frequently rebalanced portfolios are more likely to purchase loans with standardized covenants, potentially because standardization alleviates information processing costs related to loan monitoring and screening. We also document that covenant standardization is associated with greater loan and CLO note rating agreement between credit rating agencies, further supporting the relation between lower information costs and covenant standardization. Overall, our study provides evidence that loan securitization is related to the design of standardized financial covenants.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12186","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial covenants and securitization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2018","56","1","YINGHUA LI,\u00a0\n                     YINGHUA LI\n                     School of Accountancy, Arizona State UniversitySearch for more papers by this authorYUPENG LIN,\u00a0\n                     YUPENG LIN\n                     NUS Business School, National University of SingaporeSearch for more papers by this authorLIANDONG ZHANG,\u00a0\n                     LIANDONG ZHANG\n                     \n                        orcid.org/0000-0003-0844-7811\n                     \n                     School of Accountancy, Singapore Management UniversitySearch for more papers by this author","Trade Secrets Law and Corporate Disclosure: Causal Evidence on the Proprietary Cost Hypothesis","This study exploits the staggered adoption of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD) by U.S. state courts as an exogenous shock that generates variations in the proprietary costs of disclosure.

Our evidence suggests that this asymmetry is due to financial intermediaries reducing their exposure to announcement risks by providing liquidity asymmetrically. This asymmetry creates a predictable upward bias in prices that increases preannouncement, and subsequently reverses, confounding short-window announcement returns as measures of earnings news and risk premia. These findings provide an alternative explanation for asymmetric return reactions to firms' earnings news, and help explain puzzling prior evidence that announcement risk premia precede the actual announcements. Our study informs methods for research centering on earnings announcements and offers a possible explanation for patterns in returns around anticipated periods of heightened inventory risks, including alternative firm-level, industry-level, and macroeconomic information events.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12189","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading costs and financial intermediaries without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We conduct an experiment proposed using a registration-based editorial process. We compare a baseline where the auditor does not provide consulting services to conditions where auditors provide consulting to audit clients or where auditors only provide consulting services to non-audit clients. Our unique design provides evidence on whether providing consulting to non-audit clients strengthens the salience of a client-cooperative social norm that reduces audit quality. We do not find differences in audit quality by condition in our planned analysis, however we find greater variation in audit quality in the conditions where auditors provide consulting services compared to the baseline. In unplanned analyses, our results suggest providing consulting services increases auditor cooperation with managers, increasing audit quality when managers prefer high audit quality and decreasing audit quality when managers prefer low audit quality.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12197","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['audit quality', 'consulting services', 'social norm']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of audit quality and the impact of consulting services, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using a large sample of transcripts, we identify 3,834 buy-side analysts from 701 institutional investment firms who participated (i.e., asked a question) in 13,332 conference calls to examine the determinants and implications of their participation.

First, the predictive power of Twitter comments increases with the extent to which they fairly represent the broad customer response to products and brands. The predictive power is greater for firms whose major customers are consumers rather than businesses. Second, the word-of-mouth effect of Twitter comments is greater when advertising is limited. Third, a detailed analysis of the identity of the tweet handles provides the additional insights that the predictive power of the volume of Twitter comments is dominated by \u201cthe wisdom of crowds,\u201d whereas the predictive power of the valence of Twitter comments is largely attributable to expert comments. Furthermore, Twitter comments not only reflect upcoming sales, but also capture an unexpected component of sales growth.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12183","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['fairly', 'customer response', 'wisdom of crowds']","The article touches on the concept of fairness in representing customer responses, which aligns with moderate woke themes, but primarily focuses on technical aspects of predictive power and sales rather than social justice or ethical critiques."],["2018","56","3","ETI EINHORN,\u00a0\n                     ETI EINHORN\n                     Tel Aviv UniversitySearch for more papers by this authorNISAN LANGBERG,\u00a0\n                     NISAN LANGBERG\n                     Tel Aviv University\n                     University of HoustonSearch for more papers by this authorTSAHI VERSANO,\u00a0\n                     TSAHI VERSANO\n                     Tel Aviv UniversitySearch for more papers by this author","Cross-Firm Real Earnings Management","Our analysis is rooted in the notion that stockholders can learn about the fundamental value of any firm from observing the earnings reports of its rivals.

We predict that reduced lender monitoring in turn leads shareholders to intensify their monitoring and demand increased voluntary disclosure from managers. Consistent with this expectation, we find that managers are more likely to issue earnings forecasts and forecast more frequently when traded CDSs reference their firms. We further find a stronger impact of CDS availability on firm disclosure when (1) lenders have higher ability and propensity to hedge credit risk using CDSs, and (2) lender monitoring incentives and monitoring strength are weaker. Consistent with an increase in shareholder demand for public information disclosure induced by a reduction in lender monitoring, we find a stronger effect of CDSs on voluntary disclosure for firms with higher institutional ownership and stronger corporate governance. Overall, our findings suggest that firms with traded CDS contracts enhance their voluntary disclosure to offset the effect of reduced monitoring by CDS-protected lenders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12194","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit default swaps and their impact on voluntary disclosure without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that auditors with prepopulated (vs. blank) workpapers are less accurate for risks that have changed because they are more likely to stick with last year's assessments, and also to work fast. We then show that auditor characteristics reflecting a preference for accuracy reduce, but do not eliminate, these effects. Finally, we provide exploratory evidence that sticking and working fast are associated with, respectively, motivated reasoning and superficial processing.

We find that rationing in a dynamic model with persistent types is extra costly, since the types that are eliminated in period 1 might have been attractive in period 2. The cost of rationing increases with the variability of production. If production levels are increasing (decreasing), the principal will be cautious when eliminating types with low variable (fixed) costs in period 1, since these types are particularly profitable in period 2. When production is more stable over time, harsher rationing can be applied in period 1, followed by less harsh rationing, if any, in period 2.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12236","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement and resource rationing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is shown that, paradoxically, firm owners allow managers with higher propensity to manipulate the short-term stock price to push for higher powered and more short-term-focused equity incentives. Such managers also work harder, and manipulate more, but may not generate higher firm profits. The model is consistent with existing empirical findings about the relationship between manipulation and equity pay, suggesting that heterogeneity in manager manipulation propensities may be an important driver of heterogeneity in pay. Novel testable predictions are developed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.12237","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managerial compensation and stock price manipulation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To test the effect of debt contract enforcement on borrowers' timely loss recognition, we exploit the staggered introduction of enhanced debt contract enforcement in Indian states as a natural experiment, where the implementation of the enforcement is exogenous to the accounting choices and borrowing behavior of firms. The main results show that enhanced enforcement has a significant positive effect on the timeliness of loss recognition of borrowing firms. We find that the effect is strongest for firms that increased their overall borrowing and for firms with high levels of tangible assets, consistent with a collateral-based explanation.

We propose that such states increase the reliance on affective inputs in judgments and decisions. In accord with this proposition, results from six studies show that the priming of uncertainty (vs. certainty) consistently increases the effects of a variety of affective inputs on consumers\u2019 judgments and decisions. Primed uncertainty is shown to amplify the effects of the pleasantness of a musical soundtrack (study 1), the attractiveness of a picture (study 2), the appeal of affective attributes (studies 3 and 4), incidental mood states (study 6), and even incidental states of disgust (study 5). Moreover, both negative and positive uncertainty increase the influence of affect in decisions (study 4). The results additionally show that the increased reliance on affective inputs under uncertainty does not necessarily come at the expense of a reliance on descriptive attribute information (studies 2 and 5), and that the increased reliance on affect under uncertainty is distinct from a general reliance on heuristic or peripheral cues (study 6). The phenomenon may be due to uncertainty threatening the self, thereby encouraging a reliance on inputs that are closer to the self and have high subjective validity.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/1/1/2938882","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on psychological states and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This research uncovers an alternative kind of conspicuous consumption that operates by shifting the focus from the preciousness and scarcity of goods to the preciousness and scarcity of individuals. Furthermore, the authors examine cultural values (perceived social mobility) and differences among cultures (North America vs. Europe) to demonstrate moderators and boundary conditions of the positive associations derived from signals of busyness.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/1/118/2736404","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['status symbol', 'cultural values', 'social mobility', 'busyness', 'human capital']","The article explores the societal implications of busyness as a status symbol, touching on cultural values and perceived social mobility, which align with moderate woke themes.

It assumes a practice theory lens and is based on an ethnographic inquiry into cosplay, a time- and resource-intensive form of pop culture masquerade and craft consumption. Prolonged engagement in the cosplay community leads to growing emotional, material, temporal, and competence-related costs, which hinder playful experiences.

We present a method for measuring neural data to assess the degree of similarity between multiple brains experiencing the same advertisements, and we demonstrate that this similarity can predict important marketing outcomes. Since neural data can be sampled continuously throughout an experience and without effort and conscious reporting biases, our method offers a useful complement to measures requiring active evaluations, such as subjective ratings and willingness-to-pay (WTP) scores. As a case study, we use portable electroencephalography (EEG) systems to record the brain activity of 58 moviegoers in a commercial theater and then calculate the relative levels of neural similarity, cross-brain correlation (CBC), throughout 13 movie trailers. Our initial evidence suggests that CBC predicts future free recall of the movie trailers and population-level sales of the corresponding movies. Additionally, since there are potentially other (i.e., non-neural) sources of physiological similarity (e.g., basic arousal), we illustrate how to use other passive measures, such as cardiac, respiratory, and electrodermal activity levels, to reject alternative hypotheses. Moreover, we show how CBC can be used in conjunction with empirical content analysis (e.g., levels of visual and semantic complexity).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/1/160/2938969","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['diverse', 'consumers', 'advertisers']","The article discusses the impact of advertising on a diverse set of consumers, indicating some awareness of diversity in marketing.

Using five studies, we demonstrate that a large proportion of respondents in paid MTurk studies claim a false identity, ownership, or activity in order to qualify for a study. The extent of misrepresentation can be unacceptably high, and the responses to subsequent questions can have little correspondence to responses from appropriately identified participants. We recommend a number of remedies to deal with the problem, largely involving strategies to take away the economic motive to misrepresent and to make it difficult for Turkers to recognize that a particular response will gain them access to a study. The major short-run solution involves a two-survey process that first asks respondents to identify their characteristics when there is no motive to deceive, and then limits the second survey to those who have passed this screen. The long-run recommendation involves building an ongoing MTurk participant pool (\u201cpanel\u201d) that (1) continuously collects information that could be used to classify respondents, and (2) eliminates from the panel those who misrepresent themselves.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/1/211/3737805","tutorials in consumer research","JCR","Marketing","3","['misrepresentation', 'economic motive', 'survey', 'identity']","The article addresses issues of misrepresentation and economic motives within survey research, which touches on ethical considerations but does not primarily focus on social justice or progressive themes.

On one hand, consumers spend billions of dollars every year to alleviate different kinds of pain. On the other hand, millions of individuals participate in extremely painful leisure pursuits. In trying to understand this conundrum, we ethnographically study a popular adventure challenge where participants subject themselves to electric shocks, fire, and freezing water. Through sensory intensification, pain brings the body into sharp focus, allowing individuals to rediscover their corporeality. In addition, painful extraordinary experiences operate as regenerative escapes from the self. By flooding the consciousness with gnawing unpleasantness, pain provides a temporary relief from the burdens of self-awareness. Finally, when leaving marks and wounds, pain helps consumers create the story of a fulfilled life. In a context of decreased physicality, market operators play a major role in selling pain to the saturated selves of knowledge workers, who use pain as a way to simultaneously escape reflexivity and craft their life narrative.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/1/22/2970267","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['pain', 'experience', 'self-awareness', 'narrative']","The article explores the concept of pain in consumer experiences, which touches on individual well-being and self-awareness.

Results from seven studies demonstrate that consumers experiencing cultural distinctiveness are likely to evaluate favorably and prefer brands associated with a related cultural group, in a choice set or consumption situation, even if they are not the favored option in the choice set. This pro-in-group bias for culturally related brands is driven by a heightened desire to connect with \u201chome,\u201d which prompts consumers to expand their in-group boundaries to include the related cultural group within a broadened definition of home. However, this pro-in-group bias is attenuated when the salience of intergroup rivalries is high, where experiencing cultural distinctiveness can backfire and result in less favorable evaluations of brands associated with a related cultural group.

At the same time, providing evidence for unconscious causation is fraught with methodological difficulties. We outline why it is vital to uphold standards of evidence for claims regarding unconscious processes, as it is precisely a lack of rigor on this front that has generated a countermovement by researchers skeptical of dual-process models in general and unconscious processes in particular. We contend that the skeptics have offered valid causes for concern, which we leverage to formulate six concrete recommendations for future research on consciousness. Researchers should (1) specify the process level at which they claim evidence for unconscious processes, (2) not confuse unconscious influences with unconscious processes, (3) carefully choose between different operational definitions of awareness, (4) maximally satisfy four criteria for awareness measures, and (5) complement measurement with experimental manipulations of awareness. Finally, we recommend to (6) refrain from hard claims about unconscious causation that transcend the limitations of the evidence, recognizing that consciousness is a continuous construct.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/2/266/3045129","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['consciousness', 'unconscious processes', 'evidence', 'methodological']","The article discusses the importance of understanding unconscious processes in consumer behavior, which touches on ethical considerations in research methodology.

Based on analysis of qualitative data from interviews with emerging adults between adolescence and settled adulthood, we argue that middle-class emerging adulthood is marked by a focus on exploratory experience consumption: the consumption of novel experiences with cultural capital potential. This tacit, embodied orientation is rooted in a habitus developed during entitled childhoods but is also shaped by an anticipated shortage of opportunities for exploration after they marry and have children. Accordingly, middle-class emerging adults voraciously consume exploratory experiences in the present with their imagined future selves in mind. The class basis for this orientation is examined through our analysis of interviews with working-class emerging adults whose lifestyles are characterized not by exploratory experience consumption but by a desire for the familiar, a fear of the unknown, and a longing for stability. The discussion focuses on how the middle-class consumer orientation toward exploratory experiences reinforces class (dis)advantage, life trajectories, and inequality.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/2/332/3057431","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['inequality', 'class', 'exploratory experiences', 'cultural capital']","The article discusses themes of class disparity and how middle-class consumption patterns contribute to reinforcing inequality, which aligns with social justice themes.

How do consumers manage when their routines are disrupted? Practice theorists assert that practices are important to understanding consumption and stress their shared, repetitive, and conventional nature. When practices are stable, they are performed effortlessly, producing feelings of ease and trust in a predictable world. People are often unaware of the embodied competencies, or practical understandings, involved in the performance of these practices. However, practical understandings become apparent when elements of practices are misaligned. Our findings advance Giddens\u2019s (1984) theorization of ontological security by showing how the interplay between practical and discursive understandings and material configurations works to produce different ontological states that we call embedded security, embedded insecurity, discursive insecurity, acclimating security, and new embedded security.

Five studies provide convergent evidence for our proposition and reconcile the present results with previous findings. We found that participants receiving a round offer are more (less) likely to accept (counter) than those who receive comparable precise offers.

Results from six experiments, employing objects and products with various shapes and hues, show that increasing color saturation increases size perceptions. This influence is explained by the tendency for saturated color to capture attention, which, in turn, is explained by the arousal that saturated color stimulates. This research also demonstrates several downstream outcomes of the effect of saturation on size perceptions: evaluations are more favorable\u2014and willingness to pay is higher\u2014for products with high (low) saturation when usage goals call for large (small) size. Additionally, participants choose more of a product to fill a container with higher saturation. Further, the saturation of an object\u2019s color affects the perceived size of its surroundings, such that when a product with high (vs. low) saturation is used as a benchmark, the environment is perceived to be comparatively smaller (vs. larger).

Such responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings. However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i.e., products featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction, intelligence, responsiveness, and/or personality) can also satisfy (at least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one\u2019s current social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior. These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists: drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in design and function, the results reveal potentially important consequences for human-to-human relationships.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/2/414/2939535","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['social exclusion', 'social belongingness', 'prosocial behavior', 'anthropomorphic products']","The article discusses the impact of anthropomorphic products on social exclusion and belongingness, which ties into themes of social connection and psychological well-being.

Seven studies provide converging evidence in both field and laboratory settings that people find a message less persuasive, and are less likely to act on its implications, when it is surrounded by empty space than when it is not. These effects are mediated by perceptions of message strength. That is, message recipients infer that a message conveys a less strong opinion when empty space surrounds it and are consequently less likely to accept its implications. This effect does not occur when the space surrounding the message is generated randomly by a computer or when the message is attributed to a low-credibility source. When a message is counterattitudinal, surrounding it by empty space decreases the disposition to counterargue its implications and increases acceptance of the position advocated. When recipients are under cognitive load, however, they use the space surrounding the message as a heuristic basis for judgment and are less persuaded when the message is surrounded by empty space.

In a compelling extension of this work into the field of consumer behavior, Jung, Garbarino, Briley, and Wynhausen (this issue) demonstrate that people residing in more liberal (vs. conservative) areas register more complaints with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and dispute more resolutions offered in response to their complaints. Furthermore, liberals were found to object more strongly to the hypothetical imposition of an unanticipated banking fee, and this effect was mediated by system justification. Inspired by Jung and colleagues, we investigated the hypothesis that liberals would also be more likely to buy and boycott consumer products for political reasons. We analyzed data from the American National Election Studies and European Social Surveys and discovered that, even after we adjusted for demographic factors, liberals in the United States and leftists in all 15 European countries were more likely than conservatives and rightists to report having bought a product\u2014or refrained from buying a product\u2014for political reasons.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/503/4091330","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['political reasons', 'complaints', 'status quo', 'buying', 'boycotting']","The article explores how political ideologies influence consumer behavior, particularly in terms of buying and boycotting for political reasons, indicating a moderate focus on social justice themes.

The model identifies latent states representing identifiable, accessible, and actionable dynamic customer segments, and captures the movements between states or segments. A pattern emerges that is consistent with the theory of behavioral spillover and inconsistent with the theory of moral licensing, including a tendency to buy organic products in an increasing number of product categories over time. The order in which organic products are adopted is inversely related to the behavioral costs of adopting them. The employed approach provides a firm basis for personalized communication aiming to increase cross-selling of organic products, increase the sale of less popular organic products, and accelerate movements from segments buying few organic products to segments buying organic more consistently.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/519/3067077","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['organic', 'behavioral spillover', 'moral licensing']","The article focuses on consumer behavior in the organic food market, which has some implications for sustainability, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

A series of five studies demonstrate that within the context of creativity contingency, monetary rewards induce a performance focus, while social-recognition rewards induce a normative focus. Such performance (normative) focus in turn enhances (attenuates) approach motivation to be original and hence leads to higher (lower) originality in a creative task. Thus, this work not only advances the current understanding of how and why two types of widely used creativity-contingent external rewards may have contrasting effects on creative performance, but it also offers important practical insights to managers who utilize reward systems in cultivating consumer creativity in their innovation platforms.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/536/3738819","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['social-recognition', 'creativity', 'normative focus', 'consumer creativity']","The article discusses the contrasting effects of social-recognition versus monetary rewards on creativity, highlighting a normative focus that aligns with themes of motivation and recognition beyond mere financial incentives.

What specific arrangements of objects and tactics do they mobilize to make everyday life more tolerable (if not more equal)? The politics of respectability (respectability) is one such arrangement. Respectability makes life more tolerable by offering a counternarrative that disavows stigma through status-oriented displays. This strategy of action emerged alongside mass consumer culture in the late 19th century, but what relevance does it have to those who are stigmatized in contemporary consumer culture? Based on ethnographic interviews and observations with middle-class African Americans, respectability remains an important strategy that has undergone profound changes since its origins while still operating in similar ways. In the late 20th century it fractured into two related but distinct counternarratives: (1) \u201cdiscern and avoid,\u201d which seeks distance from whatever is stigmatized, and (2) \u201cdestigmatize,\u201d using black culture as a source of high status. Perceptions of how well either counternarrative manages stigma depend on how ideology, strategy, and consumption are connected via specific sociohistorical features of place and individual power resources. I illustrate those connections through four cases that show perceived success and perceived failure for each counternarrative.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/554/3064204","articles","JCR","Marketing","8","['stigma', 'respectability', 'racial', 'counternarrative', 'consumption']","The article addresses themes of racial stigma and the politics of respectability, emphasizing how marginalized groups navigate societal perceptions through consumption.

Liquid consumption is needed to explain behavior within digital contexts, in access-based consumption, and in conditions of global mobility. It highlights a consumption orientation around values of flexibility, adaptability, fluidity, lightness, detachment, and speed. Implications of liquid consumption are discussed for the domains of attachment and appropriation; the importance of use value; materialism; brand relationships and communities; identity; prosumption and the prosumer; and big data, quantification of the self, and surveillance.

The current article theorizes that one important motivation for WOM is social acceptance. To fulfill this motivation, people form and maintain existing relationships with others. Building on research in interpersonal relationships, we theorize that when communicating with strangers, people attempt to self-enhance to attract strangers into forming relationships with the self; when sharing with friends, on the other hand, people attempt to connect emotionally in order to maintain existing ties. A series of seven studies provide backing for this simple yet encompassing framework. Results of the current article provide insights into the motivations behind WOM, synthesize prior findings, and show that people systematically share different content with strangers versus friends.

Building on the notion that satiation is constructed during consumption, we demonstrate that people satiate faster when they employ a greater working memory capacity. We establish this result in four studies across multiple experienced stimuli while using a range of measures of working memory capacity. We also develop insight into the underlying cognitive mechanism using mediation and moderation to show that people utilizing a larger working memory capacity satiate faster because they more deeply encode and process each stimulus. This subsequently leads to a sense that they have consumed that stimulus more times, and hence greater satiation. This provides direct evidence that working memory capacity is a critical cognitive mechanism underlying satiation, and it helps us potentially understand a range of satiation phenomena.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/633/3092334","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive mechanisms related to consumer behavior and satiation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When and How Enhanced Product Aesthetics Discourage Usage and Lower Consumption EnjoymentGet access","Marketers invest a lot of resources in product aesthetics and design, but does this strategy always lead to favorable consumer outcomes? While prior research suggests enhanced aesthetics should have a uniformly positive influence on pre-usage evaluations and choice, the present research examines the downstream effects of nondurable product aesthetics on consumption behavior and post-consumption affect. First, we document an inhibiting effect of aesthetics on actual consumption. We find that highly aesthetic products elicit greater perceptions of effort in their creation, and that consumers have an intrinsic appreciation for such effort. Because the consumption process indirectly destroys the effort invested to make the product beautiful, people reduce consumption of such products because usage would entail destroying something they naturally appreciate. Second, we show that in cases where individuals do consume a beautiful product, they exhibit lower consumption enjoyment and increased negative affect. These negative post-consumption outcomes are mediated in parallel by concerns over having actually destroyed the effort that made the product beautiful as well as the decrements in beauty that become visible when aesthetic products are made less attractive through consumption. Across a series of studies, we challenge the common assumption that enhanced aesthetics always lead to positive consumer outcomes.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/651/3096199","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['aesthetics', 'consumption', 'enjoyment']","The article discusses consumer behavior in relation to product aesthetics, focusing on the psychological impact of beauty and consumption.

The idea that close interpersonal relationships help people cope with pain has received increasing support in social psychology. It is unknown, however, whether close brand relationships can do the same and, if so, why. Seven studies are reported here to fill this knowledge gap. Experiments 1a and 1b are the first to demonstrate that when confronted with a loved brand (vs. control), consumers are able to insulate themselves against physical pain. Experiment 2 provides evidence that the pain-insulating effectiveness of close brand relationships is not just due to brands representing mere distractions. Using a multistudy, multimethod approach to test for mediation, experiments 3 through 5 provide convergent empirical support for the hypothesis that feelings of social connectedness mediate the effect of close brand relationships on pain. Study 6 categorizes the 1,105 brand love essays written by participants in our experiments to show that loved brands provide feelings of social connectedness, mostly metaphorically and indirectly and, to a lesser extent, directly. In summary, close brand relationships can help insulate consumers against physical pain due to brands\u2019 ability to provide a semblance of social connectedness.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/673/3096200","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the psychological effects of brand relationships on consumer pain without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This tutorial aims to strengthen two weak links that impede statistical mediation analysis from reaching its full potential. The first weak link is the path from mediator to outcome, which is a correlation. Six conditions are described that this correlation needs to meet in order to make plausible causal inferences: directionality, reliability, unconfoundedness, distinctiveness, power, and mediation. Recommendations are made to increase the plausibility of causal inferences based on statistical mediation analysis. Sweetspot analysis is proposed to establish whether an observed mediator-outcome correlation falls within the region of statistically meaningful correlations. The second weak link is the communication of mediation results. Four components of informative communication of mediation analysis are described: effect decomposition, effect size, difference testing, and data sharing. Recommendations are made to improve the communication of mediation analysis. A review of 166 recently published mediation analyses in the Journal of Consumer Research, a reanalysis of two published datasets, and Monte Carlo simulations support the conclusions and recommendations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/3/692/3978091","tutorial in consumer research","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on statistical mediation analysis and causal inference without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations in business practices.

Decades of research suggest that preference and choice are often intertwined. Choice often originates from one\u2019s preferences. As a result, choice is often seen as a reflection of preference, leading people to infer their preferences by observing their own choices. We suggest that self-control attenuates this process. Because self-control often overrides personal desires in favor of external constraints, norms, and long-term considerations, we propose that self-control is associated with a sense of attenuated correspondence between choice and individual preference. Five experiments suggest that when the notion of self-control is salient, people are less likely to see their choices as reflecting their preferences or to infer preference from previous choices. As a result, evoking the notion of self-control attenuates the tendency to view choice as indicative of preference, even in contexts unrelated to where self-control was originally evoked. Thus, self-control shapes not only choice itself, but also the perceived meaning of choice.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/724/3829543","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-control', 'choice', 'preference']","The article primarily focuses on the psychological aspects of choice and self-control, lacking explicit references to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This article examines a new signal of self-expressiveness: whether the product is polarizing\u2014that is, whether some people strongly like the product and other people strongly dislike the product. Eight studies examine how polarization and its associated indicator in the online domain (a bimodal distribution of user star ratings) affects consumer preferences. The results indicate that polarizing products are perceived to be more self-expressive and to serve as stronger indicators of one\u2019s tastes and personality. As a result, people find products with bimodal rating distributions to be more desirable when they experience temporary or chronic low self-concept clarity. Further, people evaluate products with bimodal distributions more favorably in consumption contexts in which self-expression is important. These effects emerge when the bimodal distribution pertains to a self-expressive attribute (e.g., style) but not when it pertains to a non-self-expressive attribute (e.g., quality). Last, the effect is especially strong when people have the motivation to express an individual- rather than group-level identity. Hence, polarizing products are seen as vehicles for individual self-expression.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/759/3788001","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['self-expression', 'polarizing', 'identity']","The article discusses self-expression and identity in the context of consumer preferences, indicating a moderate engagement with themes of individuality and social signaling.

Five studies conducted across different experimental contexts and different product categories provided convergent evidence showing that exposure to moral violations increases consumers\u2019 subsequent conformity in consumption. Moreover, the effect disappears (a) when the moral violator has already been punished by third parties (study 4) and (b) when the majority-endorsed option is viewed as being complicit with the moral violation (study 5).

The results indicate that potential donors make inferences about the soliciting organization based on the aesthetics of the solicitation materials. In general, highly aesthetic elements increase perceptions of organizational professionalism, which consequently leads to greater donations. However, aesthetic enhancement can backfire; when high levels of aesthetics with cost implications (e.g., embossed cardstock, gold ink) are combined with high levels of aesthetics without cost implications (e.g., attractive background, appealing font), perceptions of organizational wastefulness discourage donations. Thus, the most effective solicitation is not the most beautiful but rather one offering high levels of aesthetics without cost implications and low levels of aesthetics with cost implications. The studies demonstrate these effects in the field and in the lab and also identify moderators of the negative effect of aesthetics with cost implications on donations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/794/3739802","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['nonprofit', 'donor', 'aesthetics', 'organizational professionalism']","The article discusses the impact of design elements in nonprofit donor solicitations, which touches on ethical considerations in fundraising practices.

In contrast, four experiments demonstrate the benefits of \u201cout-of-category imitation\u201d for copycats, and the harmful effect on the imitated brand. Copycats are evaluated more positively in a related category, because consumers appraise the similarity between copycat and imitated brand more positively than in the core category, independent of the perceived similarity itself. This is due to a reduced salience of norms regarding imitation in the related category. Moreover, the results show a damaging backlash effect of out-of-category imitation on the general evaluation of the imitated brand and on its key perceived product attributes. The findings replicate across student, MTurk, and representative consumer samples; multiple product categories; and forms of brand imitation. This research demonstrates that out-of-category brand imitation helps copycat brands and hurts national leading brands much more than has so far been considered, which has managerial and public policy implications.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/816/3778194","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of brand imitation and consumer evaluation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Viewing such time-money tradeoffs in terms of a reservation wage rate for consumers, we identify a wage-rate asymmetry between two elicitation procedures: (a) Money-Elicit (MEL): state the minimum amount of money, M, that you would accept in return for spending a given number of hours, T; and (b) Time-Elicit (TEL): state the maximum number of hours, T, that you would spend in return for accepting a given amount of money, M. While these procedures are normatively equivalent, we propose that TEL (vs. MEL) wage rates are higher because time scarcity receives a higher weight in TEL judgments. In eight studies including both hypothetical and real settings, we document the wage-rate asymmetry, the time scarcity process, and a downstream consequence of TEL (vs. MEL) reducing the likelihood of accepting a time-money tradeoff.

We obtain support for our theoretical framework across a pilot study, four lab studies, and one field study by examining how images evoked using different sensory modalities differentially influence variables shown in past research to vary along psychological distance: (1) the imagined distance between the consumer and the stimulus, (2) product perceptions on other dimensions of psychological distance, and (3) persuasion when matched with other dimensions of psychological distance.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/877/3829544","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on sensory imagery and psychological distance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Findings from six studies show that the frames people adopt when thinking about health challenges influence their optimism about overcoming those challenges, and that their culture moderates this effect. In cultures where the independent self is highly accessible, individuals adopting an initiator frame (how will I act, regardless of the situations I encounter?) were more optimistic than those adopting a responder frame (how will I react to the situations I encounter?); the converse occurred for individuals from cultures where the interdependent self is highly accessible. Moreover, mediation and moderation evidence revealed that this interactive effect of culture and frame on optimism was driven by people\u2019s ability to easily imagine the recovery process. These effects held for distinct health challenges (cancer, diabetes, flood-related illness, traumatic injury) and across single-country and cross-country samples, and they impacted positive health outcomes and decisions ranging from anticipated energy, physical endurance, and willingness to take on more challenging physical therapy to intentions to get vaccinated, stick to a doctor-recommended diet, and undertake a physically strenuous vacation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/895/3876300","articles","JCR","Marketing","4","['optimism', 'health challenges', 'culture', 'interdependent self', 'independent self']","The article discusses the impact of cultural frames on optimism in the context of health challenges, which touches on themes of well-being and cultural sensitivity.

This research proposes a theory for self-worth restoration through the consumption of high-intensity sensory stimuli. Four studies demonstrate that not only do individuals facing self-threat prefer high-intensity sensory consumption (HISC) but also that this consumption restores their self-worth. This propensity for HISC is negated after individuals are allowed to engage in additional self-affirmation tasks. The findings are documented in both the visual domain (as evidenced by a preference for more intense and saturated colors) and the auditory domain (as evidenced by a preference for louder audio levels). The consumption of high-intensity sensory stimuli elevates individuals\u2019 arousal levels, which in turn minimizes rumination on thoughts related to the threat and thus restores one\u2019s self-worth. The distractive nature of HISC and its subsequent impact on self-worth restoration is shown to operate regardless of the valence of the sensory consumption. Finally, the propensity for HISC is negated after individuals experience an arousal-elevating threat, providing additional support for the underlying process.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/4/916/3865427","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['self-worth', 'consumption', 'self-affirmation']","The article primarily focuses on consumer behavior and self-worth restoration through sensory consumption, lacking a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Eight experiments show that people delegate difficult decisions, regardless of the decision\u2019s importance, and regardless of their potential surrogate\u2019s expertise. Delegation stems from a desire to avoid responsibility for potentially making the wrong choice rather than simply the desire to avoid the possibility of a poor outcome: although anticipated disappointment with the outcome and anticipated regret about one\u2019s decision both contribute to the decision to delegate, only anticipated regret directly leads people to delegate choices to others.

Yet despite considerable interest in the consequences of setting nonspecific (vs. specific) goals, how goal specificity affects motivation throughout goal pursuit is less well understood. The current research explores the role of reference points in shaping goal specificity\u2019s effects. We propose that goal specificity alters what reference point consumers spontaneously adopt during goal pursuit: for specific goals, the end state tends to be more salient, but for nonspecific goals, the initial state should be more salient. Five studies investigate how this difference in focal reference points shapes (1) the relationship between goal progress and motivation, (2) when (i.e., at what level of goal progress) goal specificity produces the greatest difference in motivation, and (3) the underlying process driving these effects. Our findings advance understanding of the relationship between goal specificity, goal progress, and motivation, and in doing so, underscore the critical role that reference points play in goal-directed behavior.

Prior research has primarily focused on the effect of curiosity on information seeking in the present domain. The current research goes further to propose that the curiosity effect can spill over to prompt consumers to prefer indulgent options in other, unrelated domains (e.g., food, money). This situation is likely to occur because curiosity motivates individuals to seek the missing information as the specific information reward in the current domain. Such desire to obtain the information reward primes a reward-seeking goal, which in turn leads to increased preferences for indulgent options in subsequent, unrelated domains. Furthermore, the impact of curiosity on indulgent options possesses goal-priming properties as identified by the literature. That is, the effect should (1) persist after a time delay, and (2) diminish when the reward-seeking goal is satiated by the obtainment of a reward before the indulgent task.

Consequently, research suggests that information about mistakes is rarely shared with consumers. However, we find that consumers actually prefer products that were made by mistake to otherwise identical products that were made intentionally. This preference arises because consumers perceive that a product made by mistake is more improbable relative to a product made intentionally, and thus, view the product as more unique. We find converging evidence for this preference in a field study, six experiments, and eBay auction sales. Importantly, this preference holds regardless of whether the mistake enhances or detracts from the product.

Drawing on evolutionary accounts of human face perception suggesting that the face width-to-height ratio (fWHR: bizygomatic width divided by upper-face height) can signal dominance and affect its overall evaluation, this research is based on the premise that product faces are perceived in much the same way as human faces. Five experiments tested this premise. Results suggest that like human faces, product faces with high (vs. low) fWHR are perceived as more dominant. However, while human faces with high fWHR are liked less, product faces with high fWHR are liked more as revealed by consumer preference and willingness-to-pay scores. The greater preference for the high fWHR product faces is motivated by the consumers\u2019 desire to enhance and signal their own dominant status as evidenced by the moderating effects of type of goal and of usage context.

Although crowding is an omnipresent factor, it has received little attention in the marketing literature. We present six studies showing that crowding increases calorie consumption. These effects occur because crowding increases distraction, which hampers cognitive thinking and evokes more affective processing. When consumers process information affectively, they consume more calories. We show the specific reason for the increase in calories. When given a choice between several different options, people select and eat higher-calorie items, but when presented with only one option, people eat more of the same food item.

We propose that, aside from increasing sample size, researchers can also increase power by boosting the effect size. If done correctly, removing participants, using covariates, and optimizing experimental designs, stimuli, and measures can boost effect size without inflating researcher degrees of freedom.

In contrast, two sets of archival data and five lab studies show that consumers are more willing to borrow for experiential versus material purchases, even though experiential purchases tend to have a shorter physical duration. Further, framing the same purchase as more experiential than material increases willingness to borrow. This effect occurs because purchase timing is more important for experiential purchases\u2014a function of consumers\u2019 aversion to missing out on planned consumption.

In particular, consumers who are lower in appearance self-esteem evaluate a product displayed by a mannequin more negatively as compared with consumers higher in appearance self-esteem. As mannequins signal the normative standard of beauty and consumers with low self-esteem in regard to their appearance believe they fail to meet this standard, these consumers become threatened by the beauty standard when exposed to a mannequin and in response denigrate the product the mannequin is displaying. We provide evidence for the underlying process in three ways: 1) through the finding that the effect for male and female consumers with low appearance self-esteem arises only when the mannequin is displaying an appearance-related product, 2) through mediation analysis demonstrating that the mannequin conveys society\u2019s standard of beauty and that this negatively impacts product evaluations, and 3) through mitigation of the effect by removing the presence of threat via a self-affirmation task or decreasing the mannequin\u2019s beauty (e.g., marking its face, removing its hair, or removing its head).

Yet relatively little is known about the role brand preferences play in relationships. In the present research, the authors explore how the novel concept of brand compatibility, defined as the extent to which individuals have similar brand preferences (e.g., both partners prefer the same brand of soda), influences life satisfaction. The authors propose that when brand compatibility is high, life satisfaction will also be high. Conversely, because low brand compatibility may be a source of conflict for the relationship, the authors propose that it will be associated with reduced life satisfaction. Importantly, the authors predict that the effects of brand compatibility on conflict and life satisfaction will depend upon relationship power. Across multiple studies and methodologies, including experimental designs (studies 2, 3, 5) and dyadic data from real-life couples (studies 1, 4, 6), the authors test and find support for their hypotheses.

Because consumers can actively interact with smart objects, the traditional, human-centric conceptualization of consumer experience as consumers\u2019 internal subjective responses to branded objects may not be sufficient to conceptualize consumer experience in the IoT. Smart objects possess their own unique capacities and their own kinds of experiences in interaction with the consumer and each other. A conceptual framework based on assemblage theory and object-oriented ontology details how consumer experience and object experience emerge in the IoT. This conceptualization is anchored in the context of consumer-object assemblages, and defines consumer experience by its emergent properties, capacities, and agentic and communal roles expressed in interaction. Four specific consumer experience assemblages emerge: enabling experiences, comprising agentic self-extension and communal self-expansion, and constraining experiences, comprising agentic self-restriction and communal self-reduction. A parallel conceptualization of the construct of object experience argues that it can be accessed by consumers through object-oriented anthropomorphism, a nonhuman-centric approach to evaluating the expressive roles objects play in interaction.

However, most prior work on this form of sharing has examined the decision to share one\u2019s experience only after the experience is over. We investigate a distinct, unexplored aspect of the sharing process: when the decision to share is already salient during an experience and hence can impact the experience itself. We examine this research question within the context of photo-taking, an increasingly ubiquitous and integral part of people\u2019s experiences. Across two field and three laboratory studies, we find that relative to taking pictures for oneself (e.g., to preserve one\u2019s memories), taking pictures with the intention to share them with others (e.g., to post on social media) reduces enjoyment of experiences. This effect occurs because taking photos with the intention to share increases self-presentational concern during the experience, which can reduce enjoyment directly, as well as indirectly by lowering engagement with the experience. We identify several factors that moderate the effect of photo-taking goals on enjoyment, such as individual differences in the extent to which individuals care about how others perceive them and the closeness of the intended audience.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/6/1220/4627834","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['sharing', 'experience', 'self-presentational concern']","The article discusses the impact of sharing experiences on personal enjoyment, touching on themes of self-presentation and social perception.

Specifically, females are influenced by the eating patterns (i.e., healthiness/unhealthiness) of males when relationship formation motives are active, while males are influenced by the eating patterns of females when relationship maintenance motives are active. Furthermore, perceptions of relational influence differ between relationship formation and maintenance, which underlies these observed effects.

While previous work has largely shown that making donations visible to others can motivate donors, the present research shows that the effectiveness of public recognition depends on whether potential donors are under an independent (i.e., separate from others) or interdependent (i.e., connected with others) self-construal. Across seven experimental studies, an independent self-construal decreases donation intentions and amounts when the donor will receive public recognition compared to when the donation will remain private. This effect is driven by the activation of an agentic motive, wherein independents are motivated to make decisions that are guided by their own goals and self-interests, rather than being influenced by the opinions and expectations of others. This research contributes to the understanding of the nuanced roles of both public recognition and self-construal in predicting donation behavior.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/6/1257/4237396","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['charitable giving', 'public recognition', 'donation behavior']","The article discusses charitable giving and the effects of public recognition, which touches on ethical considerations in donor behavior.

Whether using decision tools to sort, screen, and eliminate options, or intuitively trying to reduce the complexity of a choice, consumers often reach a decision by making sequential, attribute-level choices. The current article explores how the order in which attribute-level choices are made in such multistage decisions affects how consumers mentally represent and categorize their chosen option. The authors find that attribute choices made in the initial stage play a dominant role in how the ultimately chosen option is mentally represented, while later attribute choices serve only to update and refine the representation of that option. Across 13 studies (six of which are reported in the supplemental online materials), the authors find that merely changing the order of attribute choices in multistage decision processes alters how consumers (1) describe the chosen option, (2) perceive its similarity to other available options, (3) categorize it, (4) intend to use it, and (5) replace it. Thus, while the extant decision-making literature has mainly explored how mental representations and categorization impact choice, the current article demonstrates the reverse: that the choice process itself can impact mental representations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/6/1307/4159194","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

For this reason, little research has examined how memories about socialism influence marketization over time. To redress this gap, we bring prior consumer research on commercial mythmaking and popular memory to bear on an in-depth analysis of the marketization of the former German Democratic Republic. We find that, owing to a progressive sequence of conflicts between commercialized memories of socialism promoted by marketing agents and countermemories advocating socialism as a political alternative, definitions of the past, and by extension, capitalism\u2019s hegemony are subject to ongoing contestation and change. Our theoretical framework of hegemonic memory making explains relationships among consumption, memory making, and market systems that have not been recognized by prior research on consumption and nostalgia.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/6/1325/4159195","articles","JCR","Marketing","6","['memory', 'marketization', 'socialism', 'capitalism', 'hegemony']","The article discusses the contestation of memories related to socialism and capitalism, indicating a critical examination of historical narratives and their impact on market systems.

Yet, in five experiments, people ascribed less value to digital than to physical versions of the same good. Research participants paid more for, were willing to pay more for, and were more likely to purchase physical goods than equivalent digital goods, including souvenir photographs, books (fiction and nonfiction), and films. Participants valued physical goods more than digital goods whether their value was elicited in an incentive compatible pay-what-you-want paradigm, with willingness to pay, or with purchase intention. Greater capacity for physical than digital goods to garner an association with the self (i.e., psychological ownership) underlies the greater value ascribed to physical goods. Differences in psychological ownership for physical and digital goods mediated the difference in their value. Experimentally manipulating antecedents and consequents of psychological ownership (i.e., expected ownership, identity relevance, perceived control) bounded this effect, and moderated the mediating role of psychological ownership. The findings show how features of objects influence their capacity to garner psychological ownership before they are acquired, and provide theoretical and practical insights for the marketing, psychology, and economics of digital and physical goods.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/6/1343/4430295","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the valuation of digital versus physical goods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One of the most efficient ways that people make sense of new objects is through feature-based association. Such associations often incorporate an enabler (e.g., the color green) to help make sense of a semantically related feature (e.g., vitamin enriched). Evidence from three studies suggests that marketers can strategically incorporate enablers in product design to help consumers make sense of an extremely incongruent feature. As a result, consumers tend to reflect more favorably on the product. Furthermore, the authors find that even if the enabler itself is incongruent and leads to lower evaluations on its own, when combined with an atypical feature the effect can still be positive. Thus, a small but semantically meaningful adjustment in design can help marketers successfully introduce extremely incongruent innovations.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/44/6/1379/4430296","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on marketing strategies for product evaluation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

By changing the nominal rate the central bank influences the liquidity premium, and hence the cost of taking leverage. Lower nominal rates make liquidity cheaper and raise leverage, resulting in lower risk premia and higher asset prices, volatility, investment, and growth.

With debt in place, shareholders pervasively resist leverage reductions no matter how much such reductions may enhance firm value. Shareholders would instead choose to increase leverage even if the new debt is junior and would reduce firm value.

After plausibly exogenous turnover, borrowers choose lenders with which their new executives have personal relationships 4.1 times as frequently, and loans from these lenders have 20 basis points lower spreads and 12.5% larger amounts. Personal relationships benefit firms across loan terms, especially during macroeconomic downturns. Increased financial flexibility from personal relationships insulated firms from financial shocks during the recent financial crisis: they exhibited less constrained investment and were less likely to layoff employees.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12589","articles","JF","Finance","2","['personal relationships', 'financial flexibility', 'employees']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of lending relationships and their financial implications, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The interest rate includes a premium to compensate lenders for expected losses in default. A borrowing constraint is generated by lenders' unwillingness to lend an amount that would trigger immediate default. When the borrowing constraint is not binding, the trade-off theory of debt holds: optimal debt equates the marginal interest tax shield and the marginal expected cost of default. Contrary to conventional interpretation, but consistent with empirical findings, increases in current or future profitability reduce the optimal leverage ratio when the trade-off theory holds.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12590","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical financial model regarding leverage and profitability without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Dry-ups predict, but do not cause, future deterioration in bank performance. Furthermore, during periods of market stress, banks with high future performance tend to increase reliance on wholesale funding.

Our data set contains the stock holdings of every German bank and those of their corresponding retail clients. We investigate (i) whether banks sell stocks from their proprietary portfolios to their retail customers, (ii) whether those stocks subsequently underperform, and (iii) whether retail customers of banks engaging in proprietary trading earn lower portfolio returns than their peers. We present affirmative evidence for all three questions and conclude that proprietary trading can, in fact, be detrimental to retail investors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12609","articles","JF","Finance","3","['conflict of interest', 'retail investors', 'detrimental']","The article discusses the negative impact of proprietary trading on retail investors, indicating some ethical considerations.

This paper provides evidence that an important determinant of higher equity volatility among research and development (R&D)-intensive firms is fewer financing constraints on firms\u2019 ability to access growth options. I provide evidence for this effect by studying how persistent shocks to the value of firms\u2019 tangible assets (real estate) affect their subsequent equity volatility.

However, higher uncertainty makes analysts\u2019 tasks harder, so it is unclear whether analyst output is more valuable in bad times. We find that in bad times, analyst revisions have a larger stock-price impact, earnings forecast errors per unit of uncertainty fall, and analyst reports are more frequent and longer.

These errors translate in turn to considerable errors in the model predictions, for example, for the magnitude of the equity premium or return predictability. We demonstrate that these nonlinearities arise from the presence of multiple highly persistent processes, which cause the exogenous states to attain values far away from their long-run means with nonnegligible probability.

We present the first evidence that contrast effects can distort prices in sophisticated and liquid markets. Investors mistakenly perceive earnings news today as more impressive if yesterday's earnings surprise was bad and less impressive if yesterday's surprise was good. A unique advantage of our financial setting is that we can identify contrast effects as an error in perceptions rather than expectations.

We show that the dynamics of arbitrage capital are self-correcting: following a shock that depletes capital, returns increase, which allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more for trades with volatile fundamentals or more time to convergence. Arbitrageurs cut their positions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable component. Financial constraints yield a positive cross-sectional relationship between spreads/returns and betas with respect to arbitrage capital. Diversification of arbitrageurs across markets induces contagion, but generally lowers arbitrageurs' risk and price volatility.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12689","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model related to arbitrage in finance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2018","73","4","HENDRIK BESSEMBINDER,\u00a0\n                     HENDRIK BESSEMBINDERSearch for more papers by this authorSTACEY JACOBSEN,\u00a0\n                     STACEY JACOBSENSearch for more papers by this authorWILLIAM MAXWELL,\u00a0\n                     WILLIAM MAXWELLSearch for more papers by this authorKUMAR VENKATARAMAN,\u00a0\n                     KUMAR VENKATARAMAN\n                     Hendrik Bessembinder is at the W.P.

Despite a temporary spike during the financial crisis, average trade execution costs have not increased notably over time. However, dealer capital commitment, turnover, block trade frequency, and average trade size decreased during the financial crisis and thereafter. These declines are attributable to bank-affiliated dealers, as nonbank dealers have increased their market commitment. Our evidence indicates that liquidity provision in the corporate bond markets is evolving away from the commitment of bank-affiliated dealer capital to absorb customer imbalances, and that postcrisis banking regulations likely contribute.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12694","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on trading costs and dealer behavior in corporate bond markets, with no mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The efficiency of asset prices is linked to the efficiency of the asset management market: if investors can find managers more easily, more money is allocated to active management, fees are lower, and asset prices are more efficient. Informed managers outperform after fees, uninformed managers underperform, while the average manager's performance depends on the number of \u201cnoise allocators.\u201d Small investors should remain uninformed, but large and sophisticated investors benefit from searching for informed active managers since their search cost is low relative to capital.

We build a life-cycle consumption-savings model, with a DC pension account and an opt-out/default choice, that produces realistic investor heterogeneity. Relative to a common age-based allocation, implementing the optimal default asset allocation implies a welfare gain of 1.5% during retirement.

We correct for the endogeneity of R&D using tax-induced changes to R&D costs. While rising imports from China lead to slower sales growth and lower profitability, these effects are significantly smaller for firms with a larger stock of R&D (about half when moving from the bottom quartile to the top quartile of R&D). We provide evidence that this effect is explained by R&D allowing firms to increase product differentiation. As a result, while firms in import-competing industries cut capital expenditures and employment, R&D-intensive firms downsize considerably less.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12691","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of R&D and its impact on profitability and competition, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

An Analysis of Mutual Fund Performance","We uncover a negative relation between herding behavior and skill in the mutual fund industry. Our new, dynamic measure of fund-level herding captures the tendency of fund managers to follow the trades of the institutional crowd. We find that herding funds underperform their antiherding peers by over 2% per year. Differences in skill drive this performance gap: Antiherding funds make superior investment decisions even on stocks not heavily traded by institutions, and can anticipate the trades of the crowd; furthermore, the herding-antiherding performance gap is persistent, wider when skill is more valuable, and larger among managers with stronger career concerns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12699","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical analysis of mutual fund performance and herding behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, aligning it with a purely profit-focused perspective."],["2018","73","5","GREGORY R.

In this context, I study the equilibrium dynamics of limit order markets. Continuous idiosyncratic liquidity shocks result in trades on both sides of the order book.

Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efficient than owner-occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12719","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of housing market speculation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2018","73","6","RIC COLACITO,\u00a0\n                     RIC COLACITOSearch for more papers by this authorMARIANO M.

Since news shocks are priced, heterogeneous exposure to long-lasting global growth shocks results in a relevant reallocation of international resources and currency adjustments.

We leverage insights from transaction cost economics to advance an uncertainty-oriented framework which can be used to explain the impact of host market government corruption on the equity-based entry strategies of MNEs. We disaggregate government corruption into two distinct components (grand corruption and petty corruption). We propose that grand and petty corruption precipitate different types of uncertainty (environmental and behavioral) which motivate MNEs to vary their equity-based foreign entry strategies (entry mode and partnering). Hypotheses pertaining to the entry strategies of MNEs under conditions of more pervasive grand and petty corruption are developed and tested with a sample of 643 Japanese investments in 30 countries between 2004 and 2007. We find that the main effect of grand corruption and the interaction between grand and petty corruption significantly impact a MNE\u2019s entry mode.

We test the drivers of this institutional change in a sample of 168 countries between 2002 and 2012 using empirical constructs from policy diffusion theory. Our findings show that the country-level decisions to adopt IFRS are not driven by local determinants but instead by adoption decisions by other, neighbouring countries and influential organizations.

To address this, we develop a new theoretical model based on institutional economics, describing how institutional arrangements promoting stability \u2013 thus supporting an entrepreneur\u2019s ability to assess risk \u2013 will lead to more imitative opportunities, while institutions promoting flexibility \u2013 thus supporting an entrepreneur\u2019s ability to respond to uncertainty by iterating \u2013 will foster more innovative opportunities.

Empirical evidence from verbal protocol analyses of managers provides strong support to our arguments. These findings contribute to the emergent literature on the critical role of cognition in decision making about foreign markets. Manager cognition potentially influences sequential/non-sequential entry decision making, possibly explaining some previously observed exceptions to internationalization process theory. The contingent role of international experience further stresses that the influence of cognition in internationalization decision making is both important and complex, involving, at least, innate cognitive processes, idiosyncratic knowledge, and international experience.

This conceptual study\u2019s objective is to explore the relational dynamics of GVC governance using an internalization theory perspective, and by linking GVC research with insights from the business network literature. GVCs are argued to be a distinct form of asymmetrical networks, associated with economizing and capability creation features, as well as costs. The orchestrating firm can thus enhance efficiency outcomes of the GVC using social mechanisms similar to those adopted by core actors in a business network. In the study, six such mechanisms were identified: (1) selectivity, (2) inclusion of non-business intermediaries, (3) joint strategizing, (4) relational capital, (5) multilateral feedback, and (6) rules for equitable value distribution. While safeguarding the GVC\u2019s efficiency, the above social mechanisms are associated with challenges and limitations, and therefore do not guarantee international competitive success. However, deployed in an integrative fashion, these social mechanisms facilitate coordination (thus economizing on bounded rationality), reduce the hazards of imperfect effort by partners (thus economizing on bounded reliability), and foster innovation and new capability development.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-017-0086-8","originalpaper","JIBS","Management & Organizations","5","['inclusion', 'equitable', 'relational', 'value distribution']","The article discusses relational dynamics and mechanisms such as 'inclusion of non-business intermediaries' and 'rules for equitable value distribution,' indicating a moderate focus on social aspects within the context of global value chains.

Such ability of politically connected firms is more useful where weak institutional impartiality in the host country inhibits neutral treatment of foreign investors.

First, whereas theory relies overwhelmingly on enhanced scale of operations as a causal mechanism through which internationalization contributes to performance, empirical studies preclude proper identification of scale-related benefits. Second, theory and empirics tend to confuse temporary difficulties experienced upon entry into international markets with examining the benefits realizable at different levels of DOI, regardless of the firm\u2019s short-term difficulties in realizing those benefits.

We focus on how the positioning of MNEs in their domestic network of strategic alliances affects their geographic scope, i.e., whether they concentrate on their home region or expand beyond it. We theorize that embeddedness in alliance networks constitutes a double-edged sword to the geographic scope of MNEs. Strong embeddedness in domestic alliance networks drives the development of location-bound firm-specific advantages (FSAs), which may narrow down MNEs\u2019 geographic scope. In contrast, moderate embeddedness leads to more non-location-bound FSAs, which reduce liability of foreignness, and hence motivate MNEs to widen their geographical scope. We thus predict a non-linear relationship between domestic alliance network embeddedness and MNE geographic scope. Furthermore, the impact of the domestic alliance network on MNE geographic scope hinges on the organizational ability to efficiently and effectively absorb resources stemming from the network.

Because firms often institute multiple SPIs, the authors are able to investigate whether different sales achievement trajectories have differential impacts on salespeople's period-end sales performance. The authors find that a steadily growing sales trajectory in a sales period is more strongly associated with period-end success than a sales trajectory that is relatively flat early but has a sharp spike later in the period. Furthermore, although salespeople who had high performance in the prior month (i.e., high-performance state) may be able to draw on superior selling strategies (compared with other salespeople), they too experience a boost in sales performance in the current month by earning SPIs. Notably, the authors also find that although earning SPIs benefits all salespeople, there is a U-shaped relationship between a salesperson's performance state and his or her month-end sales performance.

Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership.

As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership.

Two large-scale field studies in an insurance company's car insurance branch and property insurance branch provide empirical support for the hypothesized patterns.

They assess how product, user, and network characteristics influence the social contagion effect in users\u2019 spending behavior. The authors use a unique large-scale data set from a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game community\u2014consisting of users\u2019 detailed gaming activities, their social connections, and their in-game purchases of functional and hedonic products\u2014to examine the impact of gamers\u2019 social networks on their purchase behavior. The analysis, based on a double-hurdle model that captures gamers\u2019 decisions of playing and spending levels, reveals evidence of \u201csocial dollars,\u201d whereby social interaction between gamers in the community increases their in-game product purchases. Interestingly, the results indicate that social influence varies across different types of products.

Furthermore, the authors find that user experience negatively moderates social contagion for functional products, whereas it positively moderates contagion for hedonic products. In addition, dense networks enhance contagion over functional product purchases, whereas they mitigate the social influence effect over hedonic product purchases. The authors perform a series of tests and robustness checks to rule out the effect of confounding factors.

Results from four field experiments suggest that donor-related appeals have a greater effect on the donation choice decision (vs. organization-related appeals), whereas organization-related appeals have a greater effect on the donation amount decision (vs. donor-related appeals).

Even worse, scholars have shown that investor pressure also motivates firms to cut marketing investments with the aim of boosting short-term income, a practice called myopic marketing management. Extant theory still lacks an understanding of whether and how the co-occurrence of share repurchases and myopic marketing affects firm stakeholders such as investors and consumers. Using a large-scale cross-industry sample, the authors reveal that there is a higher share of firms cutting marketing investments among repurchasing firms than among nonrepurchasing firms. Furthermore, investors immediately respond negatively to myopic firms that also repurchase shares. Finally, repurchases and myopic marketing are also associated with an increase in product recalls. This first study to assess share repurchases through a marketing lens hence reveals negative effects on both the stock and the consumer markets.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.16.0200","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['myopic marketing', 'stakeholders', 'long-term investments']","The article discusses the implications of myopic marketing practices on stakeholders, indicating some awareness of ethical considerations in business.

This perspective leads them to redefine selling in terms of the interaction between actors aimed at creating and maintaining thin crossing points\u2014the locations at which service can be efficiently exchanged for service\u2014through the ongoing alignment of institutional arrangements and the optimization of relationships. This definition underscores how broad sets of human actors engage in selling processes, regardless of the roles that characterize them (e.g., firm, customer, stakeholder). A service ecosystems perspective reveals (1) that selling continues to be an essential activity, (2) how broader sets of actors participate in selling processes, and (3) how this participation may be changing.

These retailers argue that their sustainability mandates may translate into profits for suppliers, but many suppliers are cynical about these mandates because the onus to undertake the required investments is on them while potential gains may be usurped by the mandating retailer. We examine whether supplier fears are justified by studying the impact of Walmart's sustainability mandate on its suppliers\u2019 (short-term) shareholder value. Although about two-thirds of suppliers are indeed financially harmed, approximately one-third benefit. To delve deeper into this variation, we relate suppliers\u2019 short-term abnormal returns to Walmart's appropriation power and explore whether and to what extent a supplier's referent and expert power sources, derived from its marketing and operational characteristics, respectively, can counteract Walmart's appropriation attempts. We find that the supplier's marketing characteristics (its environmental reputation, brand equity, and advertising) provide it with the countervailing power needed to resist Walmart's appropriation attempts.

However, evidence from extant research raises doubt as to whether this form of recognition matters in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Using a demand shock conceptualization to capture the signaling role and demand uncertainty of such recognition, this research argues that third-party recognition for design excellence does create firm value in B2B markets. The effect varies, however, depending on certain types of chief executive officer functional experience (market and finance) and the criteria used by third parties in judging design superiority. Model-free evidence and matched-sample analysis provides empirical evidence in support of the demand shock perspective and the hypothesized effects.

Political management capital (PMC) describes firm expenditure committed to address the political and regulatory context. Neoinstitutional theory casts PMC as an institutionally expected normative response investors use when evaluating firm performance. Although limited evidence has suggested that firms benefit from PMC, the authors demonstrate its effects across financial outcomes including firm value, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Likewise, they examine how PMC interacts with a firm's product market through research-and-development (R&D) capital and advertising capital. Regression analysis of an unbalanced data set of 212 firms in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, tracked from 2003 to 2014, reveals that while PMC improves investor expectations through firm value and systematic risk, it increases idiosyncratic risk. The authors find that PMC plays both substitutive and complementary roles with R&D such that increasing levels of both PMC and R&D weakens main effects. Political management capital has limited, but substitutive, effects with advertising likely because there is less regulatory oversight on advertising versus R&D in this industry.

Drawing from power theory, this article develops a conceptual model of the influence of the social media power of partner brands on brand alliance success. The proposed framework details the partner brand's social media power potential (size and activity of the social media network), social media power exertion (different posting behaviors and comments), and their interaction. The authors test this framework with an extensive data set from the film industry, in which films function as composite products and actors represent partner brands. The data set features 442 movies, including 1,318 actor\u2013movie combinations and weekly social media data (including 41,547 coded Facebook posts). The authors apply a linear mixed-effects model, in which they account for endogeneity concerns.

A positive effect of celebrity endorsers on evaluations of advertising should be more potent with greater PDB; source expertise and trustworthiness likely underlie this effect. To test the hypotheses, the authors use moderated mediation analyses, with corrections for measurement error and endogeneity of the mediators (source expertise and trustworthiness). The results of three studies, using both manipulated and measured PDB for respondents in different countries and with a variety of endorsers, demonstrate that PDB determine the effectiveness of celebrity endorsements on attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand.

In turn, higher importance weight assigned to calorie gap information leads diet-focused shoppers to relatively prefer low-calorie food items but leads taste-focused shoppers to relatively prefer higher-calorie food items.

The findings have important implications for marketing managers, augmenting the growing stream of empirical auction studies and work on corporate social responsibility. Specifically, combining an auction with a charitable cause may result in increased revenues, but managers should ensure that they are accounting for differential compliance rates between auction formats.

The authors develop a threshold-based model to explain the inverted U-shaped effect of coupon face value on consumer spending level and show that this effect occurs when the price level of products is high, when consumers have a strong saving orientation, when they experience low information load from processing a small number of products, when they are inclined to engage in thorough product comparison, or when they have a weak preexisting preference for a specific level of product benefit.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.14.0510","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to coupon usage and spending levels without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Moreover, strategic emphasis and product complexity negatively moderate the relationship of the irregularity and scope of NPI with firm value.

Consequently, the authors draw from literature on circadian rhythms in information processing capabilities to build a novel theoretical framework on social media content scheduling and explain how scheduling attributes (i.e., time of day, content type, and TCA) affect the link clicks metric.

The present research explores how using a numerical format claim (e.g., \u201ctop 10\u201d out of 50 products) versus an equivalent percentage format claim (e.g., \u201ctop 20%\u201d out of 50 products) influences consumer judgments. Across five experiments, the authors find robust evidence of a shift in evaluations whereby consumers respond more favorably to numerical rank claims when set sizes are smaller (i.e., <100) but more favorably to percentage rank claims when set sizes are larger (i.e., >100), even when the claims are mathematically equivalent. They further show that this change in evaluations occurs because consumers commit format neglect when making their evaluations by relying predominantly on the nominal value conveyed in a rank claim and insufficiently accounting for set size.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022242918805455","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer judgments related to numerical versus percentage rank claims without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this research, the authors demonstrate the conditional influences of these two attributes as a function of the valence of average product ratings and the level of review numbers in a choice set. Specifically, they argue that the diagnosticity of the number of reviews, relative to average product ratings, increases when average product ratings are negative or neutral (vs. positive) and when the level of review numbers in a choice set is low (vs. high). As a result, when consumers choose among the best options on one of the review attributes (average product ratings or the number of reviews), their preference shifts from the higher-rated option with fewer reviews toward the lower-rated option with more reviews.

These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0653","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['social capital', 'customer retention', 'referral program']","The article focuses primarily on the economic benefits of customer referral programs, with limited emphasis on social themes.

Consistent with this, the results reveal that when God is not associated with the idea of support, the dampening effect of God salience on fear appeal compliance is eliminated.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0246","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['consumer compliance', 'fear appeals', 'persuasion']","The article explores consumer behavior in the context of fear-based advertising, but it does not engage with themes of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

A retail field study demonstrates that male customers spend more money and purchase more expensive products than their female counterparts in the presence (vs. absence) of a physically dominant male employee. This effect has a more powerful impact on male customers who lack bodily markers of dominance (shorter stature or measures linked to lower levels of testosterone). When confronted with other physically dominant (vs. nondominant) men, these male customers are particularly prone to signal status through price or logo size. Their elevated feelings of intrasexual (male-to-male) competitiveness drive them to spend more money on status-signaling, but not functional, products and to prefer and draw larger brand logos. Because pictorial exposure is sufficient for the effect to occur, these findings are not limited to in-store interactions with dominant male employees but have broad implications for marketing and advertising.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0247","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['dominance', 'status-signaling', 'competition']","The article discusses consumer behavior influenced by physical dominance and intrasexual competition, which touches on themes of social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

By procuring impressions at the STB level (often denoted \u201cprogrammatic television\u201d), advertisers can now lower per-exposure costs and/or reach viewers most responsive to advertising creatives. Accordingly, this study uses a proprietary, household-level, single-source data set to develop an instantaneous show and advertisement viewing model to forecast consumers' exposure to advertising and the downstream consequences for impressions and sales. Viewing data suggest that person-specific factors dwarf brand- or show-specific factors in explaining advertising avoidance, thereby suggesting that device-level advertising targeting can be more effective than existing show-level targeting. Consistent with this observation, the model indicates that microtargeting lowers advertising costs and raises incremental profits considerably relative to show-level targeting. Further, these advantages are amplified when advertisers can buy in real time as opposed to up front.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.15.0421","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising microtargeting and profitability without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.16.0163","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on customer retention strategies and the effectiveness of targeting high-risk customers without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Model estimates reveal that wins in professional golf tournaments (which proxy for unplanned television exposure during weekly golf tournaments) affect awareness and that paid planned advertising impacts awareness and preferences.

Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of how the effectiveness of direct marketing communications varies by value propositions. Typically, direct marketing efforts are geared toward explicitly featuring economic or relational values. To implement an effective communication strategy catering to customers' preferences, firms should understand how customers consistently evaluate these organizational marketing communications, which ultimately affect their buying behaviors. Therefore, the authors analyze marketing messages and employ content analysis to capture the two distinct types of direct marketing communications. Using data from a Fortune 500 business-to-business service firm and a robust econometric model, they find that the (1) effects of economic and relational marketing communication on customer purchase behaviors interplay and vary over time, (2) latent stock of direct marketing communication affects customer purchase behaviors, and (3) evolution of customers' perceived importance can be recovered using transaction data.

Might one's likelihood of agreeing to pursue a goal fluctuate even if nothing about the goal's objective features changes, but if instead the only change is in how the time allotted for goal pursuit is described? Seven experiments show that consumers are more likely to agree to pursue goals when the completion interval is described by duration (e.g., \u201cwithin exactly two weeks from now\u201d) instead of date (e.g., \u201cbetween today and November 17\u201d). This pattern may arise because dates, which may make it easier to retrieve competing obligations falling within the interval, lead people to focus more on the (unenjoyable) goal-pursuit process, whereas durations, which present the interval in isolation, allow people to focus more on the goal's (beneficial) outcome. These findings suggest that although how a time interval is described seems inconsequential, it has striking effects on goal-pursuit decisions and therefore has important implications for the marketing of products and actions designed to assist consumers in achieving their goals.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0088","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and decision-making without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Corrective information in the form of pictures or imagery-evoking text, as well as direct instructions to imagine the scene, changed implicit attitudes more than plain, descriptive text, which is currently the most common warning method. Image-based stimuli can change implicit attitudes because they evoke vivid visual mental imagery of counterattitudinal valence (Experiments 1\u20132). Conditions that hindered the formation of visual mental imagery blocked implicit attitude change, whereas cognitive busyness did not (Experiment 3). In short, imagery-based information changed both explicit and implicit attitudes, whereas materials not based on imagery changed only explicit attitudes.

However, this positive effect becomes weaker for relatively higher levels of frontline relational work or displayed affect and, conversely, stronger for relatively lower levels over time.

Multiple mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers' perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are, which can trigger higher expenditures.

Using daily ticket prices and attendance by theater and movie, the authors empirically examine the potential gains from differentiated movie-specific pricing as well as the increasingly common two-tier (2D/3D) uniform pricing, as compared with a full uniform pricing strategy in which a theater charges the same price for all its movies. Their results show that differential pricing leads to higher profits than the two-tier uniform pricing practice, but that the improvement is limited.

The prevailing notion is that satiation increases with similarity; hence, consumers can best slow satiation by consuming stimuli that are as different as possible. We challenge this traditional (and intuitive) view and instead propose that stimuli can be so inherently different that consumers no longer spontaneously consider them together as part of the same experience. In such cases, promoting the similarity of the stimuli can counterintuitively slow satiation. We propose that this reversal happens because finding similarities leads the consumer to place these episodes into a single ad hoc category for the ongoing experience, thereby helping the consumer fully realize the overall variety inherent across all stimuli.

This article considers a matchmaking market with network effects and strategic consumers and analyzes under what conditions matchmakers would offer more effective versus less effective matchmaking services. The authors find that stronger pricing power paradoxically leads to lower technology provision when consumers have high valuation for the matchmaking service. Moreover, network effects typically encourage matchmakers to retain the users in the market to create positive externalities, which can result in less precise matchmaking.

Unlike many DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites. Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets.

Previous research has attributed this discrepancy to givers\u2019 inaccurate predictions of the receivers\u2019 preferences. This research demonstrates that reduced price sensitivity is another important source of the deadweight loss: givers use gift prices to signal the importance of their relationship with the receiver. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the authors develop a new Bayesian gift-choice model that captures both preference predictions as well as the signaling value of price. The model is estimated on two choice-based conjoint studies for gift giving that allow for the manipulation of the giver's uncertainty about the receiver's preferences. Both studies show the strong signaling value of price, especially when givers are uncertain about receivers\u2019 preferences. Decomposition of the deadweight loss shows that the signaling value of price is an important source of welfare loss, especially in markets with heterogeneous prices.

Participants then engage in a task that is labeled as being a product-related task (e.g., a math task) or a product-unrelated task (e.g., a visual task). Although the task is the same, participants in the ownership condition perform worse on a task labeled as product-unrelated than those in the baseline condition do.

A meta-analysis of 17 years of partitioned pricing research examining 149 observations in 27 papers (N = 12,878) suggests that consumers respond more favorably to partitioned pricing than to all-inclusive pricing when the total price is absent, as the price level increases, when the surcharges are typical for the product category, when the surcharges are perceived as offering high benefit, and when the product category is utilitarian.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022243718800724","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and consumer preferences without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

While much progress has been made in building a well-validated customer-based valuation model for contractual (or subscription-based) firms, there has been little progress for noncontractual firms. Noncontractual businesses have more complex transactional patterns because customer churn is not observed, and customer purchase timing and spend amounts are more irregular.

Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms\u2019 ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews.

Many firms consider using attribution to allocate media budgets, particularly for digital media, but an important question is whether this is appropriate. An initial hurdle when answering this question is that, despite the surge in interest for media attribution in marketing academia and practice, attribution does not have an agreed-on formal definition. Therefore, this article proposes an attribution formulation based on the relative incremental contribution that each medium makes to a purchase, taking into account advertising carryover and interaction effects. The formulation shows that attribution is proportional to the marginal effectiveness of a medium times its number of exposures. This means that often-used media will have high attribution weights. However, the profit-maximizing allocation for a fixed budget is a function of advertising effectiveness, but not a function of past exposure levels. By offering analytical derivations and studying simulated and empirical data, the paper shows how attribution can offer misleading insights on how to allocate resources across media. Moreover, the empirical example demonstrates that substantial gains in purchase probability can be made using profit-maximizing allocation compared with attribution-based allocation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022243718802845","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of media attribution and budget allocation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In the model, the incumbent has a noncore technology that is used for the noncore attribute of the final product, and the entrant has a new core technology to introduce a new, higher-quality product. For the noncore technology of its product, the entrant can either license it from the incumbent or develop it in-house. The authors show that a royalty licensing contract of the noncore technology between the incumbent and the entrant has a competition-alleviating effect. More important, the effect of such licensing on the entrant\u2019s optimal quality depends on whether its core technology can significantly or only incrementally increase its product quality over the incumbent\u2019s product quality. The royalty contract will tend to increase the entrant\u2019s optimal quality when the entrant\u2019s core technology can offer a significant quality improvement over the incumbent\u2019s. By contrast, if the entrant\u2019s technology can raise its product quality only incrementally over the incumbent\u2019s product quality, the royalty contract will tend to reduce the entrant\u2019s optimal quality. A wide range of royalty licensing contracts are mutually acceptable; the incumbent (entrant) can benefit from such a contract even when the entrant pays a total royalty fee that is lower (higher) than its alternative research-and-development cost. These results hold even when the incumbent endogenously chooses its royalty licensing fee. The main results are robust to several alternative modeling assumptions (e.g., alternative game sequence, endogenous quality decision by the incumbent, alternative licensing contract).","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022243718802846","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of intercompetitor licensing and product innovation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, the numerous challenges involved in training an entire sales group force many retailers to selectively train only a subset of their salespeople. It is crucial to know when selective training can be more effective and what composition of salespeople should be trained to benefit the entire group. This study addresses these questions using data from several stores of a retailer with different sales force training policies (full, selective, and no training [control]). The authors track the degree to which salespeople applied a customer relationship\u2014building strategy taught in the training, along with more than 30 store- and salesperson-level covariates, and perform various analyses to correct for selection issues.

Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes. In addition to providing practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads consumers to anchor on the first piece of information. Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments.

Specifically, in six studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings, individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk, that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the similarity structures that exist between risks have a significant effect on risk-taking preferences in dynamic choice settings.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022243718810800","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on risk-taking behavior and decision-making processes without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

This research shows that drawing consumers\u2019 attention to their global self-improvement can increase product improvement judgments and upgrade intentions when self\u2013brand connection is high, a phenomenon the authors refer to as egocentric improvement evaluation. In line with egocentric categorization theory, which identifies the self as a dominant reference category in product judgment, the authors demonstrate cognitive drivers of the effect. Specifically, egocentric improvement evaluations are moderated by self-focus, which determines whether the self is an accessible reference category. Furthermore, the authors propose that egocentric improvement evaluations also have a motivational driver: consumers project their self-improvement onto self-connected brands to satisfy self-enhancement motives. The core effect is moderated by self-affirmation, which quells the need for self-enhancement, and by self-threat, which heightens the need for self-enhancement.

The authors examine this dependence in the context of Aravind Eye Hospitals, which delivers eye care services in India. They measure whether the marketing activities (outreach camps) of Aravind that are targeted only to poor patients produce the spillover benefit of attracting paying patients to its hospitals. Using nine years of patient-level historical data, the authors find that camps increase the flow of paying patients. These effects are comparable to the camps acting as advertising for Aravind. Using model estimates, the authors compute the incremental revenue accruing to Aravind from a camp and find that it exceeds the incremental cost of a camp.

Consistent with the psychological distance literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers become less novelty seeking and more price sensitive. These findings underscore that even with incentive alignment, preference measurement choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint analyses only represent an approximation of real-life choices. Although it is not feasible to systematically use questions with high Prob in the field, we predict and find that placing a higher probability question (such as an external validity task) at the beginning rather than the end of a questionnaire has a carryover effect on attention and information processing throughout the questionnaire, and it influences preference estimates as well.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022243718817004","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer decision-making and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The results indicate that prerelease spikes are widely prevalent: While some of them are event-driven, emerging in response to firm-created communications (e.g., trailer release), they are far more likely to emerge spontaneously. Content analysis reveals that WOM in spikes is more positive in sentiment and is more likely to deal with factual details than is WOM outside spikes.

The authors provide evidence that consumers respond to pseudo-free offers in this way because, in general, consumers generate neutral or positive attributions for why firms make these offers, and these attributions, in turn, lead consumers to perceive the pseudo-free offers as fair.

In this article, the authors incorporate consumers\u2019 decision of whether to negotiate into a demand model. The decision to negotiate hinges on how the expected discount from negotiation compares with the magnitude of a nonpecuniary cost that the consumer incurs by initiating the negotiation. The current study shows how this cost can be nonparametrically identified, separately from consumers\u2019 ability to get a discount and marginal utility of income. The application of this model to individual-level data on refrigerator transactions reveals that, conditional on negotiating, consumers get, on average, 41% of the available surplus and incur an average cost of $28 to initiate a negotiation. The magnitude of these nonpecuniary costs\u2019 not only affects retailer profits but also has implications for pricing strategy and consumer surplus.

There is a parallel extension of SCIP named ParaSCIP, which parallelizes SCIP on massively parallel distributed memory computing environments. This paper describes FiberSCIP, which is yet another parallel extension of SCIP to utilize multi-threaded parallel computation on shared memory computing environments, and has the following contributions: First, we present the basic concept of having two parallel extensions, and the relationship between them and the parallelization framework provided by UG (Ubiquity Generator), including an implementation of deterministic parallelization. Second, we discuss the difficulties in achieving a good performance that utilizes all resources on an actual computing environment, and the difficulties of performance evaluation of the parallel solvers. Third, we present a way to evaluate the performance of new algorithms and parameter settings of the parallel extensions.

It is well-known that deriving an explicit description of a projected polytope is NP-hard. Our approach does not require an explicit description of the projection, and can easily be generalized to find a maximally sized convex body of a polytopic projection. Our obtained MVE is an inner approximation of the projected polytope, and its center is a centralized relative interior point of the projection. Since FME may produce many redundant constraints, we apply an LP-based procedure to keep the description of the projected polytopes at its minimal size. Furthermore, we propose an upper bounding scheme to evaluate the quality of the inner approximations.

The problem is known to be NP-hard for general graphs. We first propose a vertex-based integer programming formulation for MIM, which is more compact compared to an edge-based formulation found in the literature. We also introduce the maximum weight induced matching problem (MWIM), which generalizes MIM so that vertices and edges have weights. We adapt the edge-based formulation to MWIM, and propose a quadratic programming formulation of MWIM based on our vertex-based formulation. We then linearize our quadratic programming formulation, and devise a Benders decomposition algorithm that exploits a special structure of the linearized formulation. We also propose valid inequalities and formulation tightening procedures to improve the efficiency of our approach. Our computational tests on a large suite of randomly generated graphs show that our vertex-based formulation and decomposition approach significantly improve the solvability of MIM and MWIM, especially on dense graphs.

The aim is to find the solution with the best expected performance, as, e.g., is typical for problems where solutions are evaluated using a stochastic simulation. Assuming Gaussian noise with known standard deviation, we derive a fully sequential sampling procedure and decision rule. The procedure starts with a single sample of the value of a proposed move to a neighboring solution and then continues to draw more samples until it is able to make a decision to accept or reject the move. Under constraints of equilibrium detailed balance at each draw, we find a decoupling between the acceptance criterion and the choice of the rejection criterion. We derive a universally optimal acceptance criterion in the sense of maximizing the acceptance probability per sample and thus the efficiency of the optimization process. We show that the choice of the move rejection criterion depends on expectations of possible alternative moves and propose a simple and practical (albeit more empirical) solution that preserves detailed balance. An empirical evaluation shows that the resulting approach is indeed more efficient than several previously proposed simulated annealing variants.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2017.0774","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

In some cases, fault-tolerance is desirable. Taking wireless networks as an example, since wireless nodes may fail due to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable that the virtual backbone has some fault-tolerance. Such a problem can be modeled as finding a minimum k-connected m-fold dominating set ((k, m)-CDS) of a graph G = (V, E), which is a node set D such that every node outside of D has at least m neighbors in D and the subgraph of G induced by D is k-connected. In this paper, we study the minimum weight (1, m)-CDS problem ((1, m)-MWCDS), and present an (H(\u03b4 + m) + 2H(\u03b4 \u2212 1))-approximation algorithm, where \u03b4 is the maximum degree of the graph and H(\u00b7) is the Harmonic number. Notice that the state-of-the-art algorithm achieves O(ln(n))-approximation factor for the (1, 1)-MWCDS problem, where n is the number of nodes. Our work improves this ratio to O(ln \u03b4) for an even more general problem: (1, m)-MWCDS. Such an improvement also enables us to obtain a (3.67 + \u03b1)-approximation for the (1, m)-MWCDS problem on unit disk graph, where \u03b1 is the performance ratio for the minimum weight m-fold dominating set problem on unit disk graph.

For the problem, we propose several mathematical formulations and their per-item and per-period Dantzig\u2013Wolfe decompositions, followed by exploring their relative efficiency in obtaining lower and upper bounds. Additionally, we observe that the optimum has a correlation with the solution values of the pricing subproblems of Dantzig\u2013Wolfe decompositions, along with the solution values of the uncapacitated problems and linear programming (LP) relaxation. Using these solution values, we build statistical estimation models (i.e., generalized linear models) that give insight on the optimal values, as well as information about how likely a setup variable is to take a value of 1 at an optimal point. We then develop an analytics branching and selection method where the information is utilized for an analytics-based branching and selection procedure to fix setup variables, which is, to our knowledge, the first research using likelihood information to improve solution qualities. This method differs from approaches that use solution values of LP relaxation (e.g., relaxation induced neighborhood search, feasibility pump, and LP and fix). The application is followed by extensive computational tests. Comparisons with other methods indicate that the optimization method is computationally tractable and can obtain better results.

Chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with radiation in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to control the primary tumor and systemic disease such as metastasis. This work introduces a mathematical model of CRT treatment scheduling to obtain optimal drug and radiation protocols with the objective of minimizing metastatic cancer cell populations at multiple potential sites while maintaining a desired level of control on the primary tumor. Dynamic programming framework is used to determine the optimal radiotherapy fractionation regimen and the drug administration schedule. We design efficient DP data structures and use structural properties of the optimal solution to reduce the complexity of the resulting DP algorithm. We derive closed-form expressions for optimal chemotherapy schedules in special cases. The results suggest that if there is only an additive and spatial cooperation between the chemotherapeutic drug and radiation with no interaction between them, then radiation and drug administration schedules can be decoupled. In that case, regardless of the chemo- and radio sensitivity parameters, the optimal radiotherapy schedule follows a hypofractionated scheme. However, the structure of the optimal chemotherapy schedule depends on model parameters such as chemotherapy-induced cell kill at primary and metastatic sites, as well as the ability of primary tumor cells to initiate successful metastasis at different body sites. In contrast, an interactive cooperation between the drug and radiation leads to optimal split-course concurrent CRT regimens. Additionally, under dynamic radio sensitivity parameters due to the reoxygenation effect during therapy, we observe that it is optimal to immediately start the chemotherapy and administer a few large radiation fractions at the beginning of the therapy, while scheduling smaller fractions in later sessions. We quantify the trade-off between the new and traditional objectives of minimizing the metastatic population size and maximizing the primary tumor control probability, respectively, for a cervical cancer case. The trade-off information indicates the potential for significant reduction in the metastatic population with minimal loss in the primary tumor control.

In the present contribution we extend an approach based on linear relaxations of the underlying nonlinearities by tailored model reformulation techniques yielding block-separable MINLPs. This combination of techniques allows us to apply a penalty alternating direction method and thus to solve highly detailed MINLPs for large-scale, real-world instances.

RD then optimizes over the variables in each subset, keeping all other variables fixed. Unlike most other decomposition methods, no knowledge of the problem structure is required. RD has been combined with a metaheuristic RDPerturb, for escaping local optima, to create a generic framework for solving mathematical programs, especially hard combinatorial nonconvex problems. The framework has been implemented as an optimization platform we call RDSolver and successfully applied to over 400 instances of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The results obtained by RDSolver are competitive with the solutions obtained by heuristics specially tailored for those problems, even though RDSolver is a general purpose mathematical programming solver.

We consider a stochastic optimization approach for this capacity expansion problem under demand and fuel price uncertainty. In a two-stage stochastic optimization model for GEP, the capacity expansion plan for the entire planning horizon is decided prior to the uncertainty realized and hence allows no adaptivity to uncertainty evolution over time. In comparison, a multistage stochastic optimization model allows full adaptivity to the uncertainty evolution but is extremely difficult to solve. To reconcile the trade-off between adaptivity and tractability, we propose a partially adaptive stochastic mixed integer optimization model in which the capacity expansion plan is fully adaptive to the uncertainty evolution up to a certain period and follows the two-stage approach thereafter. Any solution to the partially adaptive model is feasible to the multistage model, and we provide analytical bounds on the quality of such a solution. We propose an efficient algorithm that solves a sequence of partially adaptive models, to recursively construct an approximate solution to the multistage problem. We identify sufficient conditions under which this algorithm recovers an optimal solution to the multistage problem. Finally, we conduct extensive test of our algorithm on a realistic GEP problem. Experiments show that, within a reasonable computation time limit, the proposed algorithm produces a significantly better solution than solving the multistage model directly.

In particular, the link is established between smoothing and in-out separation strategies to derive generic convergence properties. For penalty function methods as well as for smoothing, we describe proposals for parameter self-adjusting schemes. Such schemes make initial parameter tuning less of an issue as corrections are made dynamically. Such adjustments also allow us to adapt the parameters to the phase of the algorithm.

The design of the flu shot, however, affects the manufacturers\u2019 capacity and profit. In return, production decisions of the manufacturers affect the societal vaccination benefit by determining coverage and timely availability.

Embedding the resulting lower bounds into a branch-and-bound framework, we obtain an exact algorithm for the original quadratic binary program.

However, for scenario-based problems, these are problematic: because the value of a tail risk measure only depends on a small subset of the support of the distribution of asset returns, traditional scenario-based methods, which spread scenarios evenly across the whole support of the distribution, yield very unstable solutions unless we use a very large number of scenarios. The proposed approach works by prioritizing the construction of scenarios in the areas of a probability distribution that correspond to the tail losses of feasible portfolios. The proposed approach can be applied to difficult instances of the portfolio selection problem characterized by high dimensions, nonelliptical distributions of asset returns, and the presence of integer variables. It is also observed that the methodology works better as the feasible set of portfolios becomes more constrained. Based on this fact, a heuristic algorithm based on the sample average approximation method is proposed. This algorithm works by adding artificial constraints to the problem that are gradually tightened, allowing one to telescope onto high-quality solutions.

Prior studies have developed various algorithms such as generalization, anatomy, and L-diversityslicing to protect individuals\u2019 privacy when transactional data are published for public use. These existing algorithms, however, all have certain limitations. For instance, generalization protects identity privacy well but loses a considerable amount of information. Anatomy prevents attribute disclosure and lowers information loss, but fails to protect membership privacy. The more recent probability L-diversity slicing algorithm overcomes some shortcomings of generalization and anatomy, but cannot shield data from more subtle types of attacks such as skewness attack and similarity attack. To meet the demand of data owners with high privacy-preserving requirement, this study develops a novel method named t-closeness slicing (TCS) to better protect transactional data against various attacks. The time complexity of TCS is log-linear, hence the algorithm scales well with large data. We conduct experiments using three transactional data sets and find that TCS not only effectively protects membership privacy, identity privacy, and attribute privacy, but also preserves better data utility than benchmarking algorithms.

Computational results show that the BCD methods are efficient for finding local solutions with good quality and they compare favorably with the branch-and-bound method-based global optimal solution procedures. From the simulation test and empirical analysis that we carry out, we are able to conclude that the mean-VaR models using kernel VaR and quadratic VaR are more robust compared to those using historical VaR or parametric VaR under the normal distribution assumption, especially when the information of the return distribution is limited.

An air-pollution control system\u2019s subsequent reliability depends on the replacement equipment selected. The corresponding problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Because the state and action space are prohibitively large, the approximate policy iteration algorithm is adapted to generate high-quality solutions. Therefore, this work replaces the value function with an affine combination of nonlinear basis functions and shows that a relaxation of the policy improvement step requires the solving of a mixed integer linear program. This approach helps in the designing of an algorithm that improves the quality of the approximation by solving a convex optimization problem. To assess the quality of resulting solutions, a lower bound is developed by considering a relaxation of the problem. In addition, two classes of heuristics are proposed based on a rolling-horizon two-stage stochastic programming formulation of the problem and a standard base-stock ordering policy. The performance of proposed policies is tested on a variety of settings, and results show that the approximate dynamic programming policies are near-optimal in the settings of interest and significantly outperform available benchmarks. The following analysis reveals that the proposed inventory replenishment policies resemble a base-stock policy with occasional deviations, and assignment and substitution decisions are determined by balancing the reliability with ordering, holding, and shortage costs.

Certain classes, however, can be efficiently solved by exploiting special structure. One such structure is the singly bordered block-diagonal (BBD) structure that lends itself to Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, Lagrangian relaxation, and branch and price. We start by introducing a new measure of goodness to capture desired features in BBD structures such as granularity of the structure, homogeneity of the block sizes, and isomorphism of the blocks. We then use it to propose a new approach to identify the best BBD structure inherent in the constraint matrix. The main building block of the proposed approach is the use of a community detection methodology in lieu of graph/hypergraph partitioning methods to alleviate one major drawback of the existing approaches in the literature: predefining the number of blocks. When tested on MIPLIB2003/2010 instances and compared against the state-of-the-art technique, the proposed algorithm is found to identify very good structures and require shorter CPU time to reach comparable bounds, in most cases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2017.0797","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization problems without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This large-scale evaluation provides insight into the types of problem instances for which each heuristic performs well or poorly.

The waiting time approximation is based on three simple ideas: the separation of patients served in a period and patients overflowed, the combination of M/M/c approximation for patients served and waiting time analysis of overflow patients, and the transformation of the performance evaluation into an optimization problem with the number of overflow patients as decision variables.

We perform a regularized, sparse linear model with a log link function where the marginal contribution to the thermodynamic cycle of each nucleotide is purely additive. The SpKG algorithm uniquely combines the Bayesian ranking and selection problem with the frequentist l1 regularized regression approach Lasso. We use this algorithm to identify the sparsity pattern of the linear model as well as sequentially decide the best regions to test before exhausting an experimental budget. We also develop two new algorithms: batch SpKG and batch SpKG-LM. The first algorithm generates more suggestions sequentially to run parallel experiments. The second one dynamically adds new alternatives, in the form of types of probes, which are created by inserting, deleting, or mutating nucleotides within existing probes.

A solution to a C&P problem basically consists of a set of one-dimensional or multidimensional items packed in/cut from one or more bins, by satisfying problem constraints and minimizing a given objective function. Normal patterns are a well-known C&P technique used to build solutions where each item is aligned to the bottom of the bin along each dimension. They are used in several C&P techniques because they can reduce the search space while preserving optimality, but their limit is that their number grows consistently when number of items and size of the bin increase. In this paper we propose a new set of patterns, called meet in the middle, that preserves optimality and leads to several interesting results. Their computation is achieved with the same time complexity as that of the normal patterns, but their number is never higher, and in practical applications it frequently shows reductions of about 50%. These new patterns are applied to improve some exact state-of-the-art C&P techniques, including arc-flow formulations, combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithms, and mixed-integer linear programs. The efficacy of the improved techniques is assessed by extensive computational tests on a number of relevant applications.

However, existing \u03b2-robust scheduling models rely on the normality assumption of uncertain parameters, and existing solution methods are based on branch and bound, which cannot solve problems of 45 jobs within 3,600 seconds. This paper proposes distributionally \u03b2-robust scheduling (DRS) models to handle uncertain processing times. The DRS models only require the lower bound, mean, and covariance information of processing times, and have the capability of handling both single and parallel machine problems. Another key contribution of this paper is to devise efficient parametric search (PS) methods for the DRS models. Specifically, we show that there exists a parameterized assignment problem (PAP), such that its optimal solutions are also optimal for the original problem. The proposed methods only need to perform a one-dimensional PS and solve a series of PAPs. We further propose a bidirectional PS to reduce the number of PAPs needed to be solved, and we design a speedup shortest augmentation path algorithm for these PAPs. Experimental results on both single and identical parallel machine problems show that the improved PS method outperforms existing algorithms by more than three orders of magnitude improvement in computation time for problems of 45 jobs, and it is able to solve problems of 500 jobs within 0.5 seconds.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2018.0807","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of machine scheduling and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we propose a joint vehicle routing and speed optimization problem to minimize the total operating cost including fuel cost. The only assumption made on the dependence between fuel cost and travel speed is that it is a strictly convex differentiable function. This problem is very challenging, with medium-sized instances already difficult for a general mixed-integer convex optimization solver. We propose a novel set-partitioning formulation and a branch-cut-and-price algorithm to solve this problem.

Then we adapt this algorithm for the purpose of pricing out columns in an exact branch-and-price algorithm for the multiarborescence version.

How companies design a contract to motivate supplier participation is an important but under-examined empirical question. Analytical studies have started to examine the optimal contract that aligns buyer-supplier incentives in joint NPD projects, but empirical evidence is scarce about the actual contracts offered by buying companies. Bridging the analytical and empirical literature, this paper compares optimal contracting derived from a parsimonious analytical model with actual behaviors observed in an experiment. In particular, we focus on how project uncertainty, buying company effort share, and buyer risk aversion influence three contractual decisions: total investment level, revenue share and fixed fee. Our results indicate significant differences between the optimal and actual behaviors. We identify various types of non-optimal contractual behaviors, which we explain from a risk aversion as well as a bounded rationality perspective. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature by showing that (1) the actual contractual behaviors could differ significantly from the optimal ones, (2) the actual contract design is sensitive to changes in project uncertainty and buying company effort share, and (3) the significant roles of risk aversion and bounded rationality in explaining the non-optimal contractual behaviors.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2017.12.001","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supplier participation', 'contractual behaviors', 'risk aversion']","The article primarily focuses on contractual behaviors and optimization in buyer-supplier relationships, lacking significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We collect longitudinal data from all acute care hospitals in California over a 7-year period from 2007 to 2013, along with data from several other sources. Analysis using a mixed-methods approach reveals that both PoC and investments in nurses and technology are lower in more competitive markets. Because future reimbursements under the pay-for-performance system will depend on the value of care provided, our results suggest that hospitals should reconsider their short-term actions that seek to increase market share and instead adopt a long-term view in which investments are made to fundamentally improve the underlying processes and PoC.

We explore how this insight extends to the variability of payments to suppliers and its impact on how risk is generated and propagates upstream. To do so, we model the financial features of a supply chain based on industry reports and empirical findings from the finance literature. Capturing policies and constraints of the agents in the supply chain in a formal model, we are able to generate and explain the behavior observed in real supply chains. We show that payment variability occurs and propagates, even if orders are constant, in a cash-constrained supply chain. Furthermore, our model reveals that payment variability may even become amplified under severe cash restrictions. We identify the factors that drive the propagation of variability\u2014the industry risk, the firm's operational leverage, the existence of a financial leverage target, and the cost of debt. The model also makes it possible to explore states of nature not often observed in practice, but that may have an effect in managers' behavior, for example, bankruptcies. We numerically illustrate the impact of these drivers on the risk of upper echelons (suppliers and suppliers' suppliers) as well as the interactions between order and payment variability. We close by summarizing our findings and discussing future research opportunities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.01.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['risk', 'payment variability', 'supply chains']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and financial modeling without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical concerns.

These problems are particularly important for low-priority patients who often remain in the queue for extended periods. We investigate two distinct approaches to address these challenges: fast track (FT) and dynamic priority queue (DPQ). Traditionally, EDs have prioritized patients using an Emergency Severity Index (ESI), in conjunction with FT, to strictly or partially dedicate resources to different ESI patient classes. With our proposed DPQ, patients are prioritized using ESI and additional real-time operational information about the patient, specifically the amount of accumulated wait time and flow time. Using an empirical simulation, we compare the impact of different resource allocation and prioritization approaches on patient length of stay (LOS), including the existing system at the ED, FT with strict and partial dedication and the possibility of shorter and less variable service times, and versions of the proposed DPQ using simple dynamic prioritization. Our main results are that: (i) the DPQ approach dominates the other approaches tested; (ii) for various ED sizes, FT with strict and partial dedication do not reduce average LOS of low-priority patients without significantly increasing average LOS of high-priority patients, unless service time mean and variance are reduced; (iii) DPQ using accumulated wait time or accumulated flow time improves performance. The results are robust to changes in the proportion of patients in each priority level. Overall, expanding decision making about patient prioritization from only considering the patient's clinical condition to also including operational data can improve performance dramatically, even without improved service times.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.03.001","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['capacity imbalances', 'low-priority patients', 'resource allocation']","The article discusses operational challenges in emergency departments, particularly focusing on low-priority patients, which hints at a concern for equitable treatment.

These companies encounter institutional environments with regulative, normative and cognitive characteristics very different from those in their home countries. SC localization uncovers and creates institutional voids; we argue that SC localization is a process of institutional change, requiring the MNE to build new institutional infrastructure. To the best of our knowledge, little is known about the institutional process of SC localization and its effects. We carry out a longitudinal case study to investigate SC localization of four MNEs in China. These MNEs are leaders of sustainable business practices in their industries, a distinction that highlights institutional voids in their SC settings. Based on the idea of fields in institutional theory, we build a mid-range theory by introducing the notion of the supply chain field. Our study identifies and contextualizes the key elements of an SC field. It recognizes MNEs, government and semi-government entities, and other participants as institutional actors who serve as architects and builders of the new SCs. We find that SC localization is an institutional process, taking place at both actor and field levels, where continuous ideation of new operations practices leads to structuring of the both the SC and SC field.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.03.002","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['sustainable', 'institutional change', 'localization', 'institutional actors']","The article discusses sustainable business practices and the institutional change required for supply chain localization, which aligns with moderate woke themes of sustainability and ethical operations.

Specifically, we know very little about a) the micro-processes involved in the way in which sub-suppliers (i.e., first-tier suppliers or sourcing agents) respond to the sustainability requirements imposed by their intermediaries; and b) the micro-level antecedents that condition their responses. To address these gaps, we used a longitudinal multiple case study method to explore multiple intermediary \u2013 sub-supplier dyads in South India's knitwear garment industry and drew upon constructs of behavioural economics. We found that the way in which intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements and their associated procedures influence both the way in which sub-suppliers perceive the procedural fairness of those requirements and the way in which they thus reciprocate. When intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements as \u2018opportunity\u2019 and engage in various procedures perceived to be procedurally fair by sub-suppliers, the latter reciprocate positively. Contrastingly, when intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements as \u2018insulation\u2019 and engage in various procedures perceived to be procedurally unfair by sub-suppliers, the latter reciprocate negatively. Under the production-dominant framing, sub-suppliers exhibit positive reciprocity only related to processing production orders. Our analysis inductively generated propositions that emphasize the important role played by framing in shaping the perceptions of fairness held by sub-suppliers towards social sustainability requirements and the reciprocity of the latter's responses to them.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.001","","JOM","Operations Management","7","['social sustainability', 'fairness', 'reciprocity', 'sub-suppliers', 'intermediaries']","The article emphasizes social sustainability and fairness perceptions, which are key themes in socially responsible business practices.

Our results show that product competition is positively associated with manufacturing-related recalls, providing evidence of a possible downside to competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Although competition is fostered by numerous federal regulations, we find that it may encourage companies to relax quality standards during the manufacturing process, which may result in lower quality products. We also find that this relationship is contingent on managerial discretion surrounding the recall decision. While product competition is associated with an increase in high severity, low discretion recalls, it is associated with a decrease in low severity, high discretion recalls.

To explore the complex supplier-customer interplay, we introduce the concept of buyer-supplier flexibility fit (i.e., the match between the level of flexibility the customer expects from its supplier and the supplier's level of flexibility) and explore its impact on the supplier's financial performance (i.e., ROA). We collected dyadic archival and survey data from 638 firms (319 supplier-customer dyads) to test these relationships. Our results indicate that buyer-supplier flexibility fit has a direct and positive impact on the supplier's ROA. Further, the strength of the relationship increases when firms operate in munificent and/or dynamic environments but does not change significantly in complex environments. The relationship also becomes stronger as the exchanged business volume increases between the customer and its supplier, and as the relationship progresses in age. In addition, our findings indicate that firms with perfect buyer-supplier flexibility fit perform best, followed by firms with negative misfit (i.e., the supplier's level of flexibility is lower than its customer's expected level of flexibility), while firms with positive misfit (i.e., the supplier's level of flexibility is higher than its customer's expected level of flexibility) are the laggards. Interestingly, positive misfit has a stronger negative impact on suppliers' ROA compared to misfit in general and negative misfit.

In particular, new technology enabled features, such as the disclosure of delivery drivers' identities, introduce a social dimension prior to delivery service encounters that might influence customers' service quality expectations and ultimately impact their attitudes towards the retailers. Building on premises of social identity theory, this research investigates effects of various crowdsourced delivery system designs related to driver disclosure and ethnicity on customers' attitudes towards the drivers and retailers. Using data from a scenario-based experiment with 761 participants across two studies, we find that crowdsourced delivery designs that disclose drivers' identity increase customers' trust, satisfaction, and repurchase intentions only when customers perceive the drivers to be similar to them, particularly with regard to ethnicity. The designs that offer driver choice options are also found to be highly regarded by customers. In addition, the similarity effects of crowdsourced delivery designs differ depending on certain customer characteristics.

In this study, we overcome several drawbacks of past research by examining not just partial versus full adoption, but the impact of meaningful assimilation of EHRs as mandated by the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act. Detailed patient-level data from acute-care hospitals in California, coupled with relevant data from several other sources, is used to conduct our analysis. After controlling for self-selection bias, our results show that overall length of stay (LOS) is reduced by 3%, on average, for all patients who undergo treatment at hospitals that are meaningful-use assimilated, relative to patients at hospitals that have fully adopted EHRs. The magnitude of this reduction is increased for patients with greater comorbidity complexity and greater coordination complexity. In addition, we find an overall decrease in readmission. We do not find such benefits among full adopters of EHRs. Thus, our study provides empirical evidence that instead of merely adoption, assimilation of EHRs at a hospital-wide level can improve the efficiency with which patients are treated, with benefits from such an assimilation being far more pronounced for patients with a greater degree of health complexities. These are important findings, because hospitals are struggling to deliver quality care to their sickest patients without severe cost overruns. Recommendations from our study point to a path forward in meeting this challenge.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.003","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['patient outcomes', 'health complexities', 'quality care']","The article discusses patient outcomes and the efficiency of healthcare delivery, which touches on ethical considerations in healthcare but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

We control for the work environment created by the POS manager's resource allocation decision, which determines the utilization levels of the three POS departments: Pre-operative (PreOp), Operating Room (OR), and Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Using patient level data from a large teaching hospital, we find that POS managers in all three departments view overtime costs as more important than idle time costs, which implies that they keep capacity slack available for patient care in each department. Further, our findings suggest that highly experienced surgeons take ownership of their patients' experience in the POS and that their patients spend less time in PreOp and the OR. We argue that not only do more experienced surgeons perform surgical procedures more efficiently, but they also coordinate better with PreOp to reduce patient waiting time there. We find that a surgeon's rating has no direct effect on a patient's actual surgery time in the OR, but that the effect of surgeon experience on actual surgery time is higher, in magnitude, for a lower-rated surgeon than for a higher-rated surgeon. Finally, we conduct a counterfactual analysis and find that highly experienced surgeons reduce the total length of a patient's stay in the POS.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.002","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of surgeon experience and patient flow without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Uncertainty can increase gradually in decision lead time, or can increase as a dramatic change in median demand. Whether the forecast evolves gradually or in jumps has important implications for the value of responsiveness, which we model as the cost premium worth paying to reduce the decision lead time (the justified cost premium). Demand uncertainty arising from jumps rather than from constant volatility increases the justified cost premium when an average jump increases median demand, but decreases the justified cost premium when an average jump decreases median demand. We fit our model to two data sets, first publicly available demand data from Reebok, then point-of-sale data from a supermarket chain. Finally, we present two special cases of the model, one covering a sudden loss of demand, and the other a one-time adjustment to median demand.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.002","research articles","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply-chain responsiveness and demand forecasting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For a retailer, introducing omnichannel capabilities requires major investments to integrate physical stores and online marketplaces, yet holds a promise of potentially enhancing revenue streams from both brick-and-mortar (BM) stores and online store channels. We assess the promise of ship-to-store capabilities by analyzing transactional data from a national jewelry retailer to study impacts of introducing ship-to-store on a retailer's operating performance, in terms of sales and customer returns. Contrary to expectations, the findings show that online sales decreased after ship-to-store was introduced, although BM store sales increased. Detailed analysis of the transactional data suggests that, after STS implementation, some customers switched from the online channel to the brick-and-mortar channel. This switch occurred mainly for high-value purchases. The customers who actually remained with and fully completed a sale using the ship-to-store service typically were those that bought low-value items. Our findings also suggest that introducing ship-to-store increased cross-channel customer returns of online purchases to physical stores. Concurrently, these new ship-to-store returns generated additional BM store sales. The paper contributes by showing how introducing ship-to-store service can have different impacts in terms of sales and returns across a retailer's channels.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.06.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of omnichannel retailing and its impact on sales and returns without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a scenario-based role-playing experiment with 253 purchasing professionals, we find that the likelihood that a recovery lead (i.e., the individual assigned to the disruption-recovery task) recommends non-retention of an incumbent critical-component supplier post disruption is higher when the recovery lead perceives that the supplier, rather than nature, had control over the supply disruption. Moreover, this direct effect is partially explained by the amount of ANGER that the recovery lead feels due to the supply disruption. Neither the direct nor the indirect effect of RESPONSIBILITY on supplier non-retention post disruption is, however, detected. This paper is among the first to offer theoretical and empirical evidence that supplier non-retention in a supply-disruption context is a function of who had control over the supply disruption. Furthermore, this paper considers the effects of emotions and illustrates that supply-management decisions are not based solely on rational (i.e., cognitive) processes but also on emotional processes. Finally, this paper challenges conceptual arguments about the association between supplier selection and retention, at least in the supply-disruption context and with regard to the individual participating in both tasks.

Despite the importance of this decision, there has been little behavioral research on what influences judgment in this task. Leveraging insights from interviews with regulators and professionals in the medical device industry, and supported by behavioral theory, we identify a set of factors that may influence the recall decision. We test the effect of these factors using a primary experiment with 167 managers from a Fortune 500 medical device firm and a replication study with 614 subjects from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find that a physician's ability to detect a defect prior to product use decreases the likelihood to recall, while a manager's understanding of the root cause of the defect increases the likelihood to recall. In a second study with 372 Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects, we find that perceived patient customer harm and perceived cost of the recall both mediate the relationship between defect detectability and recall likelihood, but that harm is more influential than cost. Further, the perceived cost of the recall also mediates the relationship between root cause understanding and recall likelihood. By uncovering behavioral factors and their mechanisms in the recall decision, this study offers important insights to both industry and regulators.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.07.003","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['safety', 'customer harm', 'recall decision']","The article discusses the implications of product recalls on customer safety and harm, which reflects a moderate awareness of ethical considerations in operations management.

We introduce an empirical measure of inventory agility based on the deviation of relative inventories (i.e., inventory days) from their forecasted values. We hypothesize that firms with higher awareness, motivation, and capabilities are associated with higher inventory agility in the presence of demand shocks. We define two empirical measures for each of the three dimensions of the AMC framework in the context of inventory agility: awareness (i.e., market orientation and technology orientation), motivation (i.e., gross margin and liquidity), and capabilities (i.e., inventory management capability and resource availability). In addition, we incorporate the constraining factor model (CFM) into the AMC framework, thus allowing for complementarity among the different measures. In this view, the influence of each of the measures on inventory agility varies according to which of the measures is the constraining factor for a given firm. The 2008 financial crisis may have tested firms' inventory agility more than any other crisis since the Great Depression, as an unprecedented collapse of demand coincided with a reduction in credit availability. Therefore, for our analysis, we use firm-level empirical data from 1263 public U.S. manufacturing firms for the 2005\u20132011 period. We find that firms' motivation and capabilities are key factors associated with inventory agility. Through the CFM, we show that identifying the constraining factors leads to a more refined understanding of the moderating effects of the antecedents of inventory agility. In a separate analysis, we find that inventory agility is positively associated with a number of financial performance metrics during crisis periods. We distinguish between inventory underages and overages and find that, during the crisis, they are both associated with lower financial performance.

Companies have to account for the fact that any misconduct at a supplier's premises may have spillover effects that reach the manufacturer or retailer. Therefore, purchasing managers have to assure that their suppliers are compliant with sustainability standards. This, however, may induce higher purchasing costs and, as a consequence, force a trade-off between (short term) economic (i.e., purchasing cost reduction) and social/environmental sustainability criteria. How purchasing managers evaluate this trade-off is particularly interesting because they often receive performance-based salaries that incentivize the reduction of purchasing costs. Our paper sheds light on this trade-off by examining how much purchasing managers are willing to pay to assure compliance along different sustainability dimensions when selecting new suppliers in a mature market setting, namely Germany. Additionally, we identify potential (individual, professional, and organization-related) factors that may impact the purchasing managers' willingness to pay (WTP), and examine their effects. Among the most surprising findings, purchasing managers on average are willing to pay a price premium for manuals that demonstrate compliance with the United Nationals Global Compact (UNGC). Furthermore, the results show that this WTP is mostly influenced (negatively) by self-enhancement (on the individual level) and/or obedience to authority (on the organizational level), but the effects of company, affiliation with the UNGC, gender, or years of experience have no influence. Moreover, the WTP is higher for the social than for the environmental dimension, and the marginal effect of accreditation on WTP depends on which combinations of dimensions are accredited.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.08.002","","JOM","Operations Management","7","['sustainability', 'social', 'compliance', 'United Nations Global Compact']","The article emphasizes sustainability and the social dimensions of purchasing decisions, indicating a focus on ethical practices in operations management.

Then we compared suppliers\u2019 contract acceptance, level of effort, and shirking across national cultures. Our findings reveal critical cultural influences on contract effectiveness. We show that although acceptance of bonus contracts is comparable across cultures, suppliers from Canada, a national culture considered low in power distance and high in humane orientation, exhibit lower acceptance rates of penalty contracts. In addition, we find evidence that suppliers associated with collectivist cultures exert more effort and shirk less in bonus contracts but these relationships also are more complex. When we compare contract effectiveness across bonus and penalty contracts within a given cultural setting, we find in all three countries greater acceptance of bonus contracts than penalty contracts. Also, after contracts are accepted, bonus contracts are more successful in China because suppliers exert greater effort and shirk less under bonus contracts than penalty contracts. However, in Canada and South Korea, the results of accepted contracts for both penalty and bonus contracts are nearly indistinguishable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.09.002","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['national culture', 'bonus contracts', 'penalty contracts']","The article discusses the influence of national culture on contract effectiveness, which touches on cultural sensitivity but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity themes.

How restaurant waiting time influences customer behavior and revenue","In many service industries, customers have to wait for service. When customers have a choice, this waiting may influence their service experience, sojourn time, and ultimately spending, reneging, and return behavior. Not much is known however, about the system-wide impact of waiting on customer behavior and resulting revenue. In this paper, we empirically investigate this by analyzing data obtained from 94,404 customers visiting a popular Indian restaurant during a 12 month period. The results show that a longer waiting time relates to reneging behavior, a longer time until a customer returns, and a shorter dining duration. To find out the impact of the consequences of waiting time, we use the empirical findings and data collected in a simulation experiment. This experiment shows that, without waiting, the total revenue generated by the restaurant would increase by nearly 15% compared to the current situation. Stimulating customers to reserve could enable restaurants to reap part of this benefit. Furthermore, the results of simulation experiments suggest that, within the boundaries of the current capacity, revenue could be increased by a maximum of 7.5% if more flexible rules were used to allocate customers to tables. Alternatively, by increasing the existing seating capacity by 20%, revenue could be boosted by 7.7% without the need to attract additional customers. Our findings extend the knowledge on the consequences of customer waiting, and enable service providers to better understand the financial and operational impact of waiting-related decisions in service settings.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.001","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of customer behavior and revenue in the restaurant industry, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers\u2019 CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e., Leader, Follower, and Laggard). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2018.05.003","","JOM","Operations Management","6","['corporate social responsibility', 'emerging countries', 'sustainability', 'ethical', 'government tactics']","The article discusses corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and their extension to suppliers in emerging countries, highlighting themes of sustainability and ethical business practices.

This means an IHO's asset supply network must perform the challenging task of supporting a fast disaster response while simultaneously maintaining cost-effective ROW development programs. We study how supply network asset flows are impacted during a mega disaster response and find that resource fluidity, the capability to reallocate resources quickly, impacts both mega disaster and ROW program asset flows within these supply networks. Using data from a large IHO's response to a mega disaster and econometric models, we find a dependency between ROW asset flow and mega disaster asset flow in IHOs with resource fluidity. As mega disaster flow increases, there is a decrease in hub-to-hub ROW asset flows and an increase in other ROW asset flows. This is contrary to most humanitarian operations research, which typically assumes independent asset flows. Because of resource fluidity, the combination of these flows does not compromise ROW operations. We use these empirical results to feed a simulation analysis that extends our research to IHOs without resource fluidity and provides actionable insights for varying types of IHOs in various demand scenarios.

While several structural supply chain characteristics have been found to be significant drivers of firm innovation and performance, a dearth of studies exists examining how these characteristics change over time by influencing one another. We develop and empirically test hypotheses on the impact of prior structural configurations and the moderating roles of absorptive capacity and industry growth on the temporal trajectory of supply chain alliance network structures. Adopting a multi-method approach, we jointly use econometric analyses and simulation experiments to examine our hypotheses from complementary angles. Specifically, we characterize the dynamic relationship between the structural mechanisms on a longitudinal dataset of 2221 unique firms and 13,668 firm-year observations spanning 25 years. We find empirical support for negative crossover effects between two key structural properties of supply chain alliance networks, a positive moderation of a firm's absorptive capacity, and a negative moderation of industry growth on the structural reinforcement. We conduct corresponding simulation experiments based on a separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) to track the temporal changes in the simulated networks' key measures. The simulation results concur with most of our empirical findings and provide additional insights complementary to our econometric analysis results. By focusing on the mechanism of temporal changes in network structural properties, our study contributes to supply chain management research with a supply network perspective and interfirm alliance network research by broadening its scope into structural dynamism.

To address these issues, our research adopts a multi-method exploratory approach to understand the nature and existence of IRI between cycle counts in a multi-channel environment based on continuous, daily IRI-related observations. These data are then used to develop a system dynamics model to further explore the interaction between employees and the rest of the inventory system. Our case study finds substantial levels of IRI on a daily basis, with varying levels of consistency and a bias toward negative errors, raising concerns as to the suitability and stability of MCDC inventory systems. We also find varying IRI effects depending on the channel, with inventory density, in particular, having mixed influences. Further, we provide evidence for substantial volatilities of daily IRI likely generated by employee-system interactions in the MCDC. Without the daily perspective, such evidence would otherwise have remained unobserved.

SaaS vendors, which charge customers based on use and continuously improve the quality of their products, have put competitive pressure on traditional perpetual software vendors, which charge a licensing fee and periodically upgrade the quality of their software.  We develop an analytical model to study the competitive pricing strategies of an incumbent perpetual software vendor in the presence of a SaaS competitor.  We find that, depending on both the SaaS quality improvement rate and the network effect, the perpetual software vendor adopts one of three different strategies:  (1) an entry deterrence strategy, (2) a market segmentation strategy, or (3) a sequential dominance strategy.  Surprisingly, we find that vendor competition does not always result in higher consumer surplus, and it might lead to a socially inefficient outcome under certain conditions.  We further show insights into how the incumbent perpetual software vendor can defend its market position by providing incremental quality improvement through patching and/or by releasing consecutive versions with major quality upgrades.  Finally, we extend our model to include the vendor\u2019s quality improvement cost and users\u2019 switching cost.

Further, to promote the \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of health information technology (HIT), CMS has been prompting hospitals to adopt and use HITs.  Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) is one such HIT and is designed to improve coordination in patient care teams and consequently patient outcomes.  We explore the impact of CPOE-enabled coordination on patient satisfaction with the care team.  In a departure from prior research that has tended to treat the team as all clinicians within a hospital unit/clinic, we conceptualize (and operationalize) patient care teams as ad hoc and patient-specific and thus comprised of those clinicians having direct contact with the patient.  In a further departure from prior research that has employed lean measures of IS use (e.g., use intentions, duration, or frequency of use), we respond to the call for rich measures of IS use by conceptualizing deep structure use (DSU) of CPOE as patient care team-level usage of CPOE features.\n\nWe draw upon adaptive structuration theory (AST) to identify faithfulness of appropriation (FOA) and consensus on appropriation (COA) as two related, but distinct, aspects of CPOE appropriation by patient care teams that affect DSU.  We also draw on relational coordination theory to conceptualize communicative coordination (CC) as team communication for coordination purposes and theorize that DSU affects patient satisfaction through CC and informating the patient differentially across high/low patient mortality risk conditions.\n\nBased on data from 224 patient care teams caring for both low and high patient mortality risk conditions, our results indicate that FOA and COA are salient predictors of DSU, and that the effect of COA on DSU is mediated by FOA.  We also observed a significant indirect effect of DSU on patient satisfaction (as mediated by communicative coordination and patient informating), but only for high patient mortality risk conditions.  Our findings are important because they show that by using CPOE in a comprehensive manner, patient care team members are better able to coordinate patient care and are able to better inform the patient about their care, ultimately leading to improved patient satisfaction.

This paper studies the design of IT artifacts to motivate voluntary contributions in online communities.  We propose a dynamic approach, which allows the effect of motivating mechanisms to change across users over time.  We characterize the dynamics of user contributions using a hidden Markov model (HMM) with latent motivation states under the public goods framework.  We focus on three motivating mechanisms on transitioning users between the latent states: reciprocity, peer recognition, and self-image.  Based on Bayesian estimation of the model with user-level panel data, we identify three motivation states (low, medium, and high), and show that the motivating mechanisms, implemented through various IT artifacts, could work differently across states.  Specifically, reciprocity is only effective to transition users from low to medium motivation state, whereas peer recognition can boost all users to higher states.  And self-image shows no effect when a user is already in high motivation state, although it helps users in low and medium states move to the high state. Design simulations on our structural model provide additional insights into the consequences of changing specific IT artifacts.  These findings offer implications for platform designers on how to motivate user contributions and build sustainable online communities. \n\n8/30/17","https://misq.umn.edu/engaging-voluntary-contributions-in-online-communities-a-hidden-markov-mode.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","4","['voluntary contributions', 'motivation', 'public goods', 'peer recognition']","The article discusses user contributions in online communities and emphasizes motivation mechanisms such as reciprocity and peer recognition, which align with themes of community engagement and social dynamics.

In this study, we investigate the competition between a new entrant and an incumbent in an SaaS market, and derive the optimal market entry strategy for the new entrant.  One interesting finding is that, when its product quality is significantly lower than that of the incumbent, the new entrant should adopt an instant-release strategy (i.e., releasing its product at the start of the planning horizon).  If the initial quality gap of the two products is small, the new entrant is better off adopting a late-release strategy (i.e., deferring the release of the new product until its quality surpasses that of the existing product).  We also find that instant-release and late-release are essentially low-quality/low-price and high-quality/high-price strategies, respectively.  In addition, we explore the scenario where the two competing products are partially compatible, and characterize the impact of asymmetric incompatibility on the two vendors\u2019 market strategies at equilibrium.  We find that the new entrant\u2019s zero-profit region expands as the level of incompatibility between the two competing products increases.

When the level of incompatibility is sufficiently high, the instant-release strategy may not be viable for the new entrant.

This complementary view involves innovative use of digital technology for re-representing the outsourced work through new conventions.  We studied a Chinese business process outsourcing supplier in-depth to learn how such re-representation is achieved through the creation of special-purpose languages.  Our research contributes to the Information Systems (IS) outsourcing literature by providing a semiotic view on the design of outsourcing work supported by digital technologies.  Three re-representation practices (i.e., dissociating the signifiers, signifying through new conventions, and embedding new conventions in the digital infrastructure) constitute the core of this view.

The 11 theories reviewed are (1) the theory of reasoned action, (2) neutralization techniques, (3) the health belief model, (4) the theory of planned behavior, (5) the theory of interpersonal behavior, (6) the protection motivation theory, (7) the extended protection motivation theory, (8) deterrence theory and rational choice theory, (9) the theory of self-regulation, (10) the extended parallel processing model, and (11) the control balance theory.  The UMISPC is an initial step toward empirically examining the extent to which the existing models have similar and different constructs.  Future research is needed to examine to what extent the UMISPC can explain different types of ISS behaviors (or intentions thereof).  Such studies will determine the extent to which the UMISPC needs to be revised to account for different types of ISS policy violations and the extent to which the UMISPC is generalizable beyond the three types of ISS violations we examined.

Thus, firms are establishing online platforms to support users in innovating services, such as iOS and Android platforms for mobile data service (MDS) innovation.  Mobile phone platforms are characterized by technology (toolkits) and policy (rules) components that could influence user\u2019s innovation.  Additionally, attributes of user innovators (lead userness) are expected to drive their innovation behavior.  Yet it is unclear how these characteristics jointly impact users\u2019 service innovation outcomes.  To address this knowledge gap, we propose a model that builds on user innovation theory and the work design literature to explain the influences of lead userness, design autonomy, toolkit support, and their interactions on user\u2019s innovation outcomes (innovation quantity) on these platforms.  We conceptualize toolkit support in terms of two constructs (i.e., ease of effort and exploration), and design autonomy in terms of three constructs (i.e., decision-making autonomy, scheduling autonomy, and work-method autonomy).  The model was tested using survey and archival data from two dominant mobile phone platforms (i.e., iOS and Android).  As hypothesized, lead userness, exploration through toolkits, and ease of effort through toolkits positively affect users\u2019 innovation quantity.

More recently, a behavioral perspective has leveraged theories from decision research to construe privacy decision making as a process in which cognitive heuristics and biases predictably occur.  In a series of experiments, we compare the predictive power of these two perspectives by evaluating the impact of changes in the objective risk of disclosure and the impact of changes in the relative perceptions of risk of disclosure on both hypothetical and actual consumer privacy choices.  We find that both relative and objective risks can, in fact, influence consumer privacy decisions.  However, and surprisingly, the impact of objective changes in risk diminishes between hypothetical and actual choice settings.  Vice versa, the impact of relative risk becomes more pronounced going from hypothetical to actual choice settings.  Our results suggest a way to integrate diverse streams of the information systems literature on privacy decision making:  in hypothetical choice contexts, relative to actual choice contexts, consumers may both overestimate their response to normative factors and underestimate their response to behavioral factors.\n\n1/25/18","https://misq.umn.edu/beyond-the-privacy-paradox-objective-versus-relative-risk-in-privacy-decision-making.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","5","['privacy', 'decision making', 'cognitive biases']","The article discusses privacy decision-making processes and incorporates behavioral perspectives that highlight cognitive biases, which align with ethical considerations in Information Systems.

However, few empirical studies have measured both effects simultaneously or have examined the factors that determine the extent of cannibalization and competition.  In this study, we develop an empirical model to identify cannibalization and competition effects simultaneously in different markets, and further examine the impacts of consumer preferences on these two effects in a single integrated framework. Using data from the U.S. personal computer (PC) industry, we find that the online market exhibits stronger cannibalization and competition than the offline market.  Both effects are significantly influenced by consumers\u2019 search behaviors and brand preferences.  Specifically, more active consumer search not only intensifies inter-brand competition but also amplifies intra-brand cannibalization.  In addition, search has a higher impact on cannibalization than competition.  Stronger consumer brand preference mitigates inter-brand competition, but its effect on intra-brand cannibalization varies for different consumer segments.  In markets consisting of more high-end consumers, the intra-brand cannibalization increases with consumer brand preference, while, in contrast, in markets consisting of more low-end consumers, the intra-brand cannibalization decreases with consumer brand preference.  The differences in consumer search and brand preference explain a significant fraction of the variations in both cannibalization and competition between different PC markets.\n\n1/30/18","https://misq.umn.edu/consumer-preferences-cannibalization-and-competition-evidence-from-the-personal-computer-industry.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of market dynamics and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, the evaluability hypothesis, which guides this research, suggests that the evaluation context is a vital factor in shaping user\u2019s assessments and perceptions about technology features. pecifically, the evaluability hypothesis proposes that technology feature perceptions, and ultimately technology choices, will change when evaluating a single technology in isolation versus when simultaneously comparing more than one. To demonstrate the evaluability hypothesis effect in the context of consumer technology product evaluations, two experiments were conducted. Both studies support the evaluability hypothesis effect, showing that when two IT products are compared, hard-to-evaluate but easy-to-compare features are perceived to be more important and therefore have a larger influence on product preferences. Alternatively, when evaluating a single product in isolation, easy-to-evaluate features are perceived to be more important and therefore have a larger influence on product preferences. Consequently, different product preferences emerge (i.e., preference reversals) in different evaluation contexts. The results demonstrate that this theoretical lens is robust to the technology evaluation context, providing important theoretical and practical insights for technology design, usability assessments, and, ultimately, product acceptance. \n\n3/19/18","https://misq.umn.edu/did-i-buy-the-wrong-gadget-how-the-evaluability-of-technology-features-influences-technology-feature-preferences-and-subsequent-product-choice.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the evaluability hypothesis in technology feature preferences without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, our understanding of how such interruptions influence individual performance is limited.  This paper distinguishes between two types of e-mail interruptions (incongruent and congruent) and draws upon action regulation theory and the computer-mediated communication literature to examine their direct and indirect effects on individual performance.  Two empirical studies of sales professionals were conducted spanning different time frames:  a survey study with 365 respondents and a diary study with 212 respondents.  The results were consistent across the two studies, showing a negative indirect effect of exposure to incongruent interruptions (interruptions containing information that is not relevant to primary activities) through subjective workload, and a positive indirect effect of exposure to congruent interruptions (interruptions containing information that is relevant to primary activities) through mindfulness.  The results differed across the two studies in terms of whether the effects were fully or partially mediated, and we discuss these differences using meta-inferences.  Technology capabilities used during interruption episodes also had significant effects:  rehearsing (fine-tuning responses to incoming messages) and reprocessing (reexamining received messages) were positively related to mindfulness, parallel communication (engaging in multiple e-mail conversations simultaneously) and leaving messages in the inbox were positively related to subjective workload, and deleting messages was negatively related to subjective workload.  This study contributes to research by providing insights on the different paths that link e-mail interruptions to individual performance and by examining the effects of using capabilities of the interrupting technology (IT artifact) during interruption episodes.  It also complements the experimental tradition that focuses on isolated interruptions.  By shifting the level of analysis from specific interruption events to overall exposure to interruptions over time and from the laboratory to the workplace, our study provides realism and ecological validity.\n10/25/2017","https://misq.umn.edu/e-mail-interruptions-and-individual-performance-is-there-a-silver-lining.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of e-mail interruptions and their impact on individual performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In the present study, we examine a reputation market in an infinitely repeated game setting, where agents sell products and trade their online reputations. Agents exert effort to provide products, and their reputations are updated based on consumer feedback.  High-type agents have a lower cost of effort than low types.  In addition to reputation system, we consider products that are randomly audited, and agents do not receive payment for products that fail the audit.  Our analysis depicts a separating equilibrium:  high-type agents can be sorted out from low-type agents by their reputations, which contrasts with the results in Tadelis (2002).  In a separating equilibrium, reputations become a perfect indicator of agents\u2019 types, effort levels, and product quality.

Because these benefits arise from data and information sharing, they are best studied at a process level.  Medical claims fraud detection is a prototypical data- and information-intensive process in insurance companies.  Fraud detection efforts of one insurer can create spillover benefits through data and information sharing that occur from socialization between analysts and labor mobility between insurers.  This paper theorizes three semicollaborative networks formed between state-level subsidiaries of insurers (regulation-bound network), between subsidiaries of an insurer parent company (sibling network), and between insurers and hospitals (risk-sharing), and hypothesizes that these networks convey information spillovers.  Because benefits realized by another party can lead to the reduction of IT investments by that party, the paper also examines the impact of semi-collaborative networks on future IT-related investments.  The empirical analysis was conducted using 2011\u2013 2013 data.  A generalized linear model with a Tweedie distribution is used to correct for the finite mass of zeros for the dependent variables.  The results reveal that the sibling network conveyed most of the spillover benefit, and the risk-sharing network did not contribute to fraud detection.

Despite their various benefits, social media technologies present two important challenges for sense-making.  First, online discourse is plagued by incoherent, intertwined conversations that are often difficult to comprehend.  Moreover, organizations are increasingly interested in understanding social media participants\u2019 actions and intentions; however, existing text analytics tools mostly focus on the semantic dimension of language.  The language-action perspective (LAP) emphasizes pragmatics; not what people say but, rather, what they do with language.  Adopting the design science paradigm, we propose a LAP-based text analytics framework to support sense-making in online discourse.  The proposed framework is specifically intended to address the two aforementioned challenges associated with sense-making in online discourse:  the need for greater coherence and better understanding of actions.  We rigorously evaluate a system that is developed based on the framework in a series of experiments using a test bed encompassing social media data from multiple channels and industries.  The results demonstrate the utility of each individual component of the system, and its underlying framework, in comparison with existing benchmark methods.  Furthermore, the results of a user experiment involving hundreds of practitioners, and a four-month field experiment in a large organization, underscore the enhanced sense-making capabilities afforded by text analytics grounded in LAP principles.

In particular, two areas that could benefit from further research concern the effects of cultural differences and communication media on deception and its detection.  Building on developments in theories of deception and its detection, we examine the question:  How do differences in culture between senders and receivers affect deception detection, especially where the deceptive communication occurs across different media?  To address this question, stimulus materials from recorded interviews were created featuring participants from the United States, Spain, and India.  Three stimulus sets were created, one each in American English, Spanish, and Indian English, and each consisting of 32 interview snippets.  Half of the snippets were honest and half were dishonest.  Each snippet represented one of four media:   full audio-visual, video only, audio only, and text only.  Veracity judges were also recruited from the same three countries as the interview participants, to independently observe and evaluate the communication both within their culture and across other cultures.

In examining the value of reciprocal relationships, we find that the use of reciprocal relationships provides significant value throughout the entire market exchange process.  First, reciprocal relationships enable an avid user to find new books and new exchange partners through exploratory browsing, which lowers her search costs.  Second, browsing reciprocal partners enables an avid user to discover books in new topics, despite that reciprocal partners share similar book tastes with the user.  Finally, reciprocal relationships help improve the exchange outcome through lower rejection rates and faster delivery speeds.

Although habituation is a neurobiological phenomenon that develops over time, past studies have only examined this problem cross-sectionally.  Further, past studies have not examined how habituation influences actual security warning adherence in the field.  For these reasons, the full extent of the problem of habituation is unknown.\n\n\t\tWe address these gaps by conducting two complementary longitudinal experiments.  First, we performed an experiment collecting fMRI and eye-tracking data simultaneously to directly measure habituation to security warnings as it develops in the brain over a five-day workweek.  Our results show not only a general decline of participants\u2019 attention to warnings over time but also that attention recovers at least partially between workdays without exposure to the warnings.  Further, we found that updating the appearance of a warning\u2014 that is, a polymorphic design\u2014substantially reduced habituation of attention.\n\n\t\tSecond, we performed a three-week field experiment in which users were naturally exposed to privacy permission warnings as they installed apps on their mobile devices.  Consistent with our fMRI results, users\u2019 warning adherence substantially decreased over the three weeks.  However, for users who received polymorphic permission warnings, adherence dropped at a substantially lower rate and remained high after three weeks, compared to users who received standard warnings.

Although some traditional call centers might prioritize customers based on their expected business values, the grounds for differential customer service on social media are unclear, since there has been little theoretical or empirical investigation of this new phenomenon.  Building on the literature of social psychology and complaint management, we hypothesize two main drivers of differential treatment:  the social media influence effect, which refers to the impact of the customer\u2019s relative standing on social media, and the bystander effect, which refers to the impact of the presence of other social media users.  To test these effects, we analyzed more than three million tweets to seven major U.S. airlines on Twitter from September 2014 to May 2015.  The evidence is clear that airlines respond to less than half of the tweets directed at them by complaining customers\u2014in contrast with traditional call centers, which are expected to address all callers.  Interestingly, we find that the airlines are more likely to respond to complaints from customers with more followers, and customers with more followers are more likely to receive faster responses, thus confirming the existence of a concealed (or at least unpublicized) social media influence effect.  We also find that airlines are less likely to respond to complaints with multiple parties mentioned, confirming the existence of the bystander effect.

Building on the contingency view of corporate governance, we argue that the presence of significant new entry threats (NET), a unique feature that differentiates the IT industry from many other industries, is a critical contextual variable that moderates this relationship.  Leveraging a novel NET measure based on text mining, we show that facing high NET, firms with boards that have a higher proportion of independent directors, who contribute to explorative organizational learning, carry out more effective monitoring, and offer independent opinions in strategic decision making, outperform firms with fewer independent board members.  To address the endogeneity of board independence, we use the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related changes to the NYSE/NASDAQ listing rules as exogenous shocks; we show that our results are robust to the correction for endogeneity issues.  Further, we show that our findings are generalizable to other high tech industries that face significant threats of new entry emerging from fast-moving industry dynamics.  However, these results do not extend to slow-moving industries that have a stable market structure and thereby face lower and more homogenous levels of NET.

The search interests of different consumers may vary even when they are searching using the same keyword.  In our study, we propose an automatic way of examining keyword ambiguity based on probabilistic topic models from machine learning and computational linguistics.  We examine the effect of keyword ambiguity on keyword performance using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that allows for topic-specific effects and nonlinear position effects, and jointly models click-through rate (CTR) and ad position (rank).  We validate our study using a novel data set from a major search engine that contains information on consumer click activities for 2,625 distinct keywords across multiple product categories from 10,000 impressions.  We find that consumer click behavior varies significantly across keywords, and such variation can be partially explained by keyword ambiguity.  Specifically, higher keyword ambiguity is associated with higher CTR on top-positioned ads, but also a faster decay in CTR with screen position.  Therefore, the overall effect of keyword ambiguity on CTR varies across positions.  Our study provides implications for advertisers to improve the prediction of keyword performance by taking into account keyword ambiguity and other semantic characteristics of keywords.

The existence of competition among solvers is an important and unique aspect of this environment, and our framework considers the competition a solver would face in each open task.

We use these variables as input into various probability prediction models adapted to our context, and make recommendations based on the probability or the expected payoff of the solver winning an open task.  We validate our framework using data from a real crowdsourcing platform.  The recommender system is shown to have the potential of improving the success rates of solvers across all abilities.  Recommendations have to be made for open tasks and we find that the relative rankings of tasks at similar stages of their time lines remain remarkably consistent when the tasks close.  Further, we show that deploying such a system should benefit not only the solvers, but also the seekers and the platform itself. \n\n8/8/18","https://misq.umn.edu/know-when-to-run-recommendations-in-crowdsourcing-contests.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['crowdsourcing', 'competition', 'recommendations']","The article discusses crowdsourcing and the recommendations for solvers, but it does not emphasize social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Prior research has causally established that social engagement (Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2013) and peer influence (Bapna and Umyarov 2015) are two important drivers of users converting to premium subscribers in such communities.  In this paper, we flip the perspective of prior research and ask whether the decision to pay for a premium subscription causes users to become more socially engaged.  In the context of the  Last.fm  music listening freemium social community, we establish, using a novel 41-month-long panel dataset, a look-ahead propensity score matching (LA-PSM)  procedure coupled with a difference-in-difference estimator of the treatment effect, that payment for premium leads to more social engagement.  Specifically, we find that paying for premium leads to an increase in both content-related and community-related social engagement.  Free users who convert to premium listen to 287.2% more songs, create 1.92% more playlists, exhibit a 2.01% increase in the number of forum posts made, and gain 15.77% more friends.

In addition to taste-matching, mobile personalization matches recommendations to a consumer\u2019s physiological need and current location.  These two additional features, referred to as need-matching and location-matching, are believed to be enablers of unplanned purchases.  However, mobile advertisers may not be able to generate recommendations that meet all personalization criteria.  Hence, mobile recommendations may be imperfect.  We examine two questions in relation to imperfect recommendations.  First, how do we use a descriptor to promote such recommendations?  Second, what personalization criterion should be downplayed to induce unplanned purchases?  Drawing upon the theory of mood congruence, we theorize that the effect of imperfect recommendation on consumers\u2019 unplanned purchases depends on their mood.  We conducted three field experiments to test our hypotheses.  Our findings indicate that (1) consumers in positive moods are more likely to form an urge to buy than those in negative moods, and this difference is larger when the descriptor is partial than when it is complete (Experiment 1); (2) need-matching is more influential on urge to buy for consumers in negative moods than for those in positive moods (Experiment 2); and (3) for taste-and-need-matched recommendations, location-matching exerts a stronger effect on the urge to buy for consumers in negative moods than for those in positive moods (Experiment 3).

Despite the initial hype, recent years have witnessed a rather stagnant use of VWs for collaboration in organizations.  Previous research recognizes that the inherent uncertainties within the VW environment are factors limiting their utilization by businesses.  Hence, grounding this research in uncertainty reduction theory (URT), we aim to understand the modalities and mechanisms for mitigating the uncertainties and fostering user trust within VWs so that they can be effectively utilized as a workplace collaboration tool.  With this end in view, we propose contextualizing and extending McKnight et al.\u2019s (2002) institutional trust framework to the context of VWs by examining the significant role that social presence has in influencing the efficacy of the institution-based trust-building factors of situational normality and structural assurance in VWs.  Using a sequential mixed methods approach (Venkatesh et al. 2013; Venkatesh, Brown, and Sullivan 2016), this research integrates results from a quantitative study with findings from a qualitative study to arrive at rich and robust inferences and meta-inferences, with the qualitative method first corroborating the inferences obtained from the quantitative research and then complementing them by identifying boundary conditions that may limit the use of VWs in organizations for workplace collaboration.  The results together suggest not only the direct but also the interactional (complementary and substitutive) influences of social presence on the relationships of the two institutional trust-building factors to user trust in VWs. \n\n4/4/18","https://misq.umn.edu/social-presence-in-virtual-world-collaboration-an-uncertainty-reduction-perspective-using-a-mixed-methods-approach.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'collaboration', 'virtual worlds']","The article discusses user trust and collaboration within virtual worlds, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or critical theory.

Our theoretical development builds upon two psychological theories, namely self-determination and psychological ownership, to identify five psychological needs (needs for autonomy, relatedness, competence, having a place, and self-identity), that we posit are particularly pertinent to social media use.  According to NAF, these psychological needs will motivate use of those social media applications that provide salient affordances to fulfill these needs.  We identify such affordances through a comprehensive review of the literature and of social media applications and put forth propositions that map the affordances to the psychological needs that they fulfill.  Our theory development generates important implications.  First, it has implications for social media research in that it provides an overarching comprehensive framework for the affordances of social media as a whole and the related psychological needs that motivate their use.  Future studies can leverage NAF to identify psychological needs motivating the use of specific social media sites based on the affordances the sites provide, and design science research can leverage NAF in the design and bundling of specific social media features to engage users.  Second, it has implications for technology acceptance research in that NAF can enrich existing models by opening up the mechanisms through which psychological needs influence user perceptions of social media and their use patterns and behaviors.

Consonantly, extant conceptual schemas can encode the semantics of a domain intensionally (e.g., ER diagram, UML class diagram) or extensionally (e.g., set diagram, UML object diagram).  However, prior IS research has exclusively focused on intensional representations and the role they play in aiding domain understanding.  In this research, we compare the interpretational fidelity of two types of representational encoding of cardinality constraints, an intensional schema using an ER diagram and its extensional analog using a set diagram.  We employ cognitive science research to conceptualize that extensional representations will enable enhanced understanding as compared with intensional representations.  Further, given that prior research suggests that the semantics of cardinality constraints remain challenging to understand, we focus on mandatory and optional cardinality constraints associated with relationships in these representations.  Based on our laboratory experiments, we find that understanding with an extensional representation was (1) at least as good as that with an intensional representation for mandatory cardinality constraints and (2) significantly better for optional cardinality constraints.  We also conducted an applicability check of our results via focus groups and found support for the perceived significance of extensional representations in practice.

Results reveal significant effects of interruptions on work and nonwork outcomes through the three mediating mechanisms.  Although positive effects are observed, the total effects of work-related interruptions are detrimental across both work and nonwork outcomes, with the strongest negative effect on work exhaustion.

In the U.S. healthcare sector, a certification mechanism called meaningful-use attestation was recently adopted as part of an effort to encourage electronic health record (EHR) adoption while also focusing healthcare providers on protecting sensitive healthcare data.  This new regime motivated us to examine how meaningful-use attestation influences the occurrence of data breaches.  Using a propensity score matching technique combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, our study shows that the impact of meaningful-use attestation is contingent on the nature of data breaches and the time frame.  Hospitals that attest to having reached Stage 1 meaningful-use standards observe fewer external breaches in the short term, but do not see continued improvement in the following year.  On the other hand, attesting hospitals observe short-term increases in accidental internal breaches but eventually see long-term reductions.  We do not find any link between malicious internal breaches and attestation.  Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights into the effective design of certification mechanisms.\n\n9/9/18","https://misq.umn.edu/meaningful-healthcare-security-does-meaningful-use-attestation-improve-information-security-performance.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['security', 'data breaches', 'certification']","The article discusses the importance of certification mechanisms in improving information security, which touches on ethical considerations regarding data protection.

A theory of evolutionary fit, which argues for the correspondence between information presentation and evolutionarily adaptive brain structures, is proposed.  This is complementary to cognitive fit, which argues for a correspondence between task and information presentation.  In two fMRI experiments, we test this theory by comparing brain activation during a graphic comprehension task using two different graph types:  bubble graphs and three-dimensional surface graphs.  In accordance with our hypotheses, we find that comprehension of three-dimensional surface graphs results in greater activation of the ventral stream and greater accuracy in graphical comprehension than bubble graphs.  We argue that this is because the human visual system is evolutionarily adapted to the comprehension of three-dimensional surfaces.  The implication is that choosing graphical representations that match what the brain is evolutionarily specialized to process can enhance graphic comprehension.\n\n8/11/18","https://misq.umn.edu/neural-correlates-of-multidimensional-visualizations-an-fmri-comparison-of-bubble-and-three-dimensional-surface-graphs-using-evolutionary-theory.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive processes and evolutionary theory related to graphical comprehension without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We assess the relative efficacy of these two outsourcing modes by identifying the effects of three factors:  task modularity, the extent of alignment between a (verifiable) performance metric and project revenue, and the extent to which project revenue is itself verifiable.  We find that if tasks are modular then multisourcing strictly dominates single-sourcing\u2014provided the verifiable performance metric and project revenue are not completely aligned.  Yet if tasks are integrated, then the choice of sourcing mode is more nuanced:  the best choice depends on trade-offs among the alignment between performance metric and project revenue, the verifiability of project revenue, and moral hazard.  If the verifiable performance metric and project revenue are perfectly aligned, or if project revenue is completely verifiable, then firms prefer single-sourcing because it entails less moral hazard than does multisourcing.  Comparative statistics for the effects of task interdependence costs and vendors\u2019 risk aversion reveal that multisourcing (single-sourcing) should be preferred when there are interdependence costs (/when vendors are strongly risk averse).\n\n10/27/18","https://misq.umn.edu/single-sourcing-versus-multisourcing-the-roles-of-output-verifiability-on-task-modularity.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourcing and project management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This approach largely misses the opportunity to extend theory from alternative logical structures that build upon reciprocal and temporal causal mechanisms; for example, the system perspective.  This paper introduces system dynamics (SD), a modeling tool capable of capturing the reciprocal and temporal causal mechanisms that underlie many complex and dynamic systems, and demonstrates its ability to extend existing variance theory from a system perspective.  To do so, we first describe the basic tenets of SD and discuss the status quo of existing SD applications in the field.  Then, we demonstrate how to model SD\u2019s unique theoretical logic of reciprocal and temporal causal structure to extend existing variance theory.  To demonstrate the use of SD in theory development, we develop and validate an SD model of the e-commerce resource endowment of a click-and-mortar firm and simulate dynamic causal relationships between the e-commerce resource endowment and firm performance over time, under various scenarios.  This case demonstrates how we can extend an existing variance theory by reconciling the inconsistent findings of prior research from a system perspective using the SD approach.

Often this takes the form of company employees devoting their time to contribute code to the efforts of projects in these communities.  Ideology has traditionally served to motivate, coordinate, and guide volunteer contributions to OSS communities.  As employees represent an increasing proportion of the participants in OSS communities, the role of OSS ideology in guiding their commitment and code contributions is unknown.  In this research, we argue that OSS ideology misfit has important implications for companies and the OSS communities to which their employees contribute, since their engagement in such communities is not necessarily voluntary.  We conceptualize two different types of misfit:  OSS ideology under-fit, whereby an employee embraces an OSS ideology more than their coworkers or OSS community do, and OSS ideology over-fit, whereby an employee perceives that their coworkers or OSS community embrace the OSS ideology more strongly than the employee does.  To develop a set of hypotheses about the implications of these two types of misfit for employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community, we draw on self-determination theory.  We test the hypotheses in a field study of 186 employees who participate in an OSS community.  We find that OSS ideology under-fit impacts the company and the community in the same way:  it decreases employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community.  In contrast, we find that OSS ideology over-fit increases commitment to the company but decreases commitment to the OSS community.  Finally, we find that employees\u2019 commitment to their company reinforces the impact of their commitment to the OSS community in driving ongoing code contributions.  This provides a holistic view of OSS ideology and its impacts among an increasingly pervasive yet understudied type of participant in OSS research.

Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive household-level transactions database matched with price information from store-level scanner data and wealth data based on local house value indices. The Great Recession provides a key source of the variation in our data, showing a large and geographically diverse impact on household incomes over time. We estimate income and wealth effects using \u201cwithin\u201d variation of income, at the household level, and wealth, at the zip code level. Our estimates can be interpreted as income and wealth effects consistent with a consumer demand model based on utility maximization. We establish a precisely measured negative effect of income on private-label shares. The effect of wealth is negative but not precisely measured. However, the estimated effect sizes are small, by contrast to prior academic work and industry views. An examination of the possible supply-side response to the recession shows only small changes in the relative price of national-brand and private-label products. Our estimates also reveal a large positive trend in private-label shares that predates the Great Recession. We examine some possible factors underlying this trend, but find no evidence that it is systematically related to specific private-label quality tiers or to the overall rate of private-label versus national-brand product introductions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1047","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic analysis of consumer demand for private-label products during the Great Recession, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The Super Bowl is well suited for evaluating advertising because viewers pay attention to the ads, more than 40% of households watch the game, and variation in ad exposures is exogenous because a brand cannot choose how many impressions it receives in each market. Viewership is primarily determined based on local preferences for watching the two competing teams. We combine Super Bowl ratings data with weekly sales data in the beer and soda categories to document three primary findings about advertising. First, the relationship between Super Bowl viewership and sales in the week leading up to the game reveals the brands customers buy to consume during the game. We find some brands are consumed while watching the game while others are not, but this is unrelated to whether a brand ever advertised during the Super Bowl or advertises in a specific year. This rejects the theory that advertising works by serving as a complement to brand consumption. Second, we find that post\u2013Super Bowl sales effects of ad viewership are concentrated in weeks with subsequent sporting events. This suggests Super Bowl advertising builds a complementarity between the brand and sports viewership more broadly. Finally, we collect data on National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament viewership to test this theory and find that the complementarity between a brand\u2019s sales and viewership of the tournament is enhanced by Super Bowl ad viewership. Together, these findings identify advertising as a determinant of why some brands outperform others for particular consumption occasions such as sports viewership.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1055","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of advertising effectiveness and consumer behavior during the Super Bowl, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This is the case for many online-based services where customers have the choice to stop interacting with the firm either by formally terminating the relationship (e.g., canceling their account) or by simply ignoring all communications coming from the firm. The standard contractual versus noncontractual categorization of customer\u2013firm relationships does not apply in such hybrid settings, which means the standard models for analyzing customer attrition do not apply. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to capture silent and overt churn. We apply our modeling framework to two different contexts\u2014a daily deal website and a performing arts organization. In contrast to previous studies that have not separated the two types of churn, we find that overt churners in these hybrid settings tend to interact more, rather than less, with the firm prior to churning; that is, in settings where both types of churn are present, a high level of activity\u2014such as customers actively opening emails received from the firm\u2014is not necessarily a good indicator of future engagement; rather it is associated with higher risk of overt churn. We also identify a large number of \u201csilent churners\u201d in both empirical applications\u2014customers who disengage with the company very early on, rarely exhibit any type of activity, and almost never churn overtly.

However, contrary to the expectation that firms respond to softening demand by lowering prices, newspapers increased subscription prices by 40%\u201360% during this period. In this paper, we explain and quantify the factors responsible for these price increases. We calibrate models of readership and advertising demand using data from a top-50 U.S. regional print newspaper. Conditional on these demand models, we calibrate the newspaper\u2019s optimal pricing equations and assess whether the increases in subscription prices are mainly rationalized by (a) the decline in overall reader willingness to pay (WTP) in the presence of heterogeneity among subscribers, which rendered it optimal for the newspaper to focus on the high WTP readers, or (b) the newspaper\u2019s reduced incentive to subsidize readers at the expense of advertisers, because of softening demand for newspaper advertising. We find that the decline in the ability of the newspaper to subsidize readers by extracting surplus from advertisers explains most of the increase in subscription prices. Of the three available subscription options (daily, weekend, and Sunday only), subscription prices increased more steeply for the daily option, a pattern consistent with the view that newspapers are driving away low valuation weekday readers while preserving Sunday readership and the corresponding ad revenues. Thus, our research augments theoretical propositions in two-sided markets by providing a formal empirical approach to unraveling the relative importance of the roles played by agents on the subsidy and demand sides in determining prices.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1060","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies and market dynamics in the print newspaper industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

In our duopoly model, when consumers are knowledgeable about their brand preferences, each manufacturer would distribute through its own vertically integrated retail outlets only. When some consumers are unsure about their brand preferences, however, it may be optimal for one of the manufacturers to also distribute through its competitor\u2019s outlets. The resulting equilibrium has several interesting properties. First, only one of the manufacturers chooses to add competitor-outlet distribution, not both\u2014even when the manufacturers are symmetric. Second, the manufacturer distributing through its competitor\u2019s outlets also distributes through its own outlets, i.e., its distribution strategy is a hybrid strategy, combining vertical integration and decentralization. Third, when the manufacturers\u2019 brands are asymmetric, it is the weaker brand that has a stronger incentive to pursue hybrid distribution. Fourth, the competitor\u2019s outlets in question welcome the new brand, even when no consumer would actually buy the new brand\u2014a case of pure showrooming. These results highlight the linkages between distribution strategy, shopping efficiency, and retail formats. Shopping costs and consumers\u2019 uncertainty about their own brand preferences create a demand for multibrand retailing, and in pursuing this demand, manufacturers may eschew the efficiency advantages of vertical integration in favor of hybrid distribution. However, the fact that only one of the manufacturers chooses to do so suggests that this strategy also has weaknesses, which we discuss in the paper.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1063","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of distribution strategies and consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this context we propose a Bayesian probability model that produces protected synthetic data. A key feature of our proposed method is that the data provider can balance the trade-off between information loss resulting from data protection and risk of disclosure to intruders. We apply our methodology to the problem facing a vendor of retail point-of-sale data whose customers use the data to estimate price elasticities and promotion effects.

This task is complicated by a lack of knowledge of all of the calendar time events that influence purchase timing. Yet, isolating calendar time variability from the natural ebb and flow of purchasing is important for accurately assessing the influence of calendar time shocks to the spending process, and for uncovering the customer-level purchasing patterns that robustly predict future spending. A comprehensive understanding of purchasing dynamics therefore requires a model that flexibly integrates known and unknown calendar time determinants of purchasing with individual-level predictors such as interpurchase time, customer lifetime, and number of past purchases. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric framework based on Gaussian process priors, which integrates these two sets of predictors by modeling both through latent functions that jointly determine purchase propensity. The estimates of these latent functions yield a visual representation of purchasing dynamics, which we call the model-based dashboard, that provides a nuanced decomposition of spending patterns. We show the utility of this framework through an application to purchasing in free-to-play mobile video games.

We found consistently that personalizing the emails by adding consumer-specific information (e.g., recipient\u2019s name) benefited the advertisers. Importantly, such content is not likely to be informative about the advertised product or the company. In our main experiment, we found that adding the name of the message recipient to the email\u2019s subject line increased the probability of the recipient opening it by 20% (from 9.05% to 10.80%), which translated to an increase in sales\u2019 leads by 31% (from 0.39% to 0.51%) and a reduction in the number of individuals unsubscribing from the email campaign by 17% (from 1.2% to 1.0%). We present similar experiments conducted with other companies, which show that the effects we document extend from objectives ranging from acquiring new customers to retaining customers who have purchased from the company in the past. Our investigation of several possible mechanisms suggests that such content increases the effort consumers make in processing the other content in the rest of the advertising message. Our paper quantifies the benefits from personalization and sheds light on the role of noninformative advertising content by analyzing several detailed measures of recipient\u2019s interaction with the message.

A successful new product always causes the firm to become more optimistic about the capability most relevant for that product; however, it can also cause the firm to become less optimistic about some of its other capabilities, including capabilities the new product does not use. The firm\u2019s optimal forward-looking product strategy accounts for short-run expected profits as well as for the information value of learning for future decisions. We find that a product sharing few or even no capabilities with potential future products can have a greater information value than a product that shares more capabilities with future products and that learning about capabilities can affect the optimal sequence of product launch decisions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1068","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on product strategy and firm capabilities without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

When unpredictable consumer preferences evolve away from a current firm\u2019s positioning, the decision to reposition is like exercising an option to be closer to current consumer preferences, or waiting to reposition later or for those preferences to return so as to be closer to the firm\u2019s current position.

I compare the optimal policy of the firm with what could be optimal from a social welfare point of view, and find that the firm repositions more frequently than is efficient when there is full market coverage.

Specifically, do those with higher expertise achieve higher influence when people endogenously choose those to whom they listen? Using an agent-based modeling simulation framework, we model the dynamics of two types of individuals, i.e., independents with exogenous information and imitators. Over the course of multiple diffusions, agents choose whom to \u201clisten to\u201d for information; dropping less useful ties and adding new ones. We find that independents can have less influence (out-degree) than imitators who collect information from multiple sources. Furthermore, this effect is exacerbated by homophily. Noise in communication channels, on the other hand, moderates these effects, yet can increase penetration rates. We show that our results are robust to alternative dynamic network structures.

We build on the choice model to derive demand curves and the unique equilibrium market outcomes (regarding prices, profits, and market shares) under duopolistic competition. In equilibrium, market shares are proportional to prices. In symmetric competition, higher equilibrium prices obtain when the ambiguity in product quality is high or when the customer base is partisan. For vertically differentiated products, the strategy of a higher-quality firm to marginally reduce ambiguity depends on the ambiguity level inherent in the product\u2013market environment.

Moreover, consumers are unsure of whether they even need the product. In this situation, we consider the role of marketing communication as generating consumers\u2019 need recognition and thus market demand for a novel product. In particular, we model marketing communication as a two-sided process that involves both firms\u2019 and consumers\u2019 costly efforts to transmit and assimilate a novel product concept. When the marketing communication takes on a two-sided process, we study a firm\u2019s different information disclosure strategies for its radical innovation. We find that sharing innovation, instead of extracting a higher rent by keeping the idea secret, can be optimal. A firm may benefit from the presence of a competitor and its communication effort. The innovator can share its innovation so that competitors can also benefit, which encourages rivals to enter the market. The presence of such competition guarantees a higher surplus for consumers, which can induce greater consumer effort in a two-sided communication process. Moreover, the increased consumer effort, in turn, prompts complementarity in the communication process and lessens the potential free-riding effect in communication between firms. Additionally, it encourages the rival firm to exert more effort, especially when the role of consumers becomes more important. Sharing innovation with a rival serves as a mechanism to induce more efforts in a two-sided communication process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1071","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on marketing communication strategies for radical innovations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, the dynamic effects are dependent on the strength of the tie. Additional strong ties (operationalized as bidirectional links) lead to immediate positive effects on decision quality. However, additional weak ties (unidirectional, follower relationships) initially lead to lower decision quality. We find beneficial learning effects, however: adding more weak ties improves decision quality once one has sufficient experience in the community. Indeed, more-experienced consumers receive, ultimately, higher positive effects on decision quality from weak ties compared with strong ties.

Studying advertising effectiveness is, however, a challenging topic for several reasons, including the endogenous nature of fundraising and ad spending rates. However, the extensive use of targeting based on designated marketing areas (DMAs) creates a setting in which neighboring counties with comparable demographics receive different levels of advertising exposure. In this paper, we leverage these advertising discontinuities along DMA borders to study the relative effectiveness of political advertising on vote shares and turnout rates in 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections. We find that negative advertising sponsored by PACs is significantly less effective than that sponsored by candidates in affecting two-party vote shares and voter turnout. A 1% increase in negative advertising by the candidate produces a significant 0.015% lift in the candidate\u2019s unconditional vote shares. By contrast, negative advertising from PACs is ineffective in increasing its supported candidate\u2019s unconditional vote share.

An OACT is typically implemented on the drug packaging, which makes it difficult for counterfeiters to produce convincing copies and easy for patients to tell the difference between authentic and counterfeit medicines. I consider a model in which an authentic firm sells its drug at a reliable source and counterfeiters and illegitimate genuine sellers sell their drugs at a dubious source. The authentic firm chooses an OACT to combat counterfeiters. I show that there may be an inverted U-shaped relationship between the complexity of the OACT and the magnitude of counterfeit medicine purchases. The nature of this relationship is a consequence of an OACT engendering two opposing effects. On one hand, adopting an OACT imposes an entry cost on counterfeiters, causing fewer counterfeiters to enter the dubious source; as a result, the drugs at this source have a greater chance of being genuine (a counterfeiters\u2019 entry-dampening effect). On the other hand, more patients head to this dubious source rather than the reliable source owing to the increased chance of obtaining a genuine drug (a patients\u2019 demand-enhancing effect). When the selected OACT is sufficiently complex to replicate, the former effect overrides the latter and thus the problem of counterfeit purchasing is relieved. However, when the OACT is not adequately sophisticated, the latter effect more than offsets the former. This leads to an anti-counterfeiting trap: the use of a rudimentary OACT may beget more counterfeit purchases. This result offers an understanding to the phenomenon that despite enormous spending on the upgrading of OACTs in recent years, annual global sales of counterfeit drugs have actually risen.

AATQ are often described as performance metrics and can respond appropriately to certain types of positive performance. Unfortunately, they also respond positively to performance-neutral strategic choices. Furthermore, whenever AATQ exceed 1, as is typical, they increase even with completely wasted investments. We note that AATQ are especially problematic measures of performance for marketers because they are biased toward reporting that investments in market-based assets (e.g., brand equity and customer satisfaction) are effective. The misuse of AATQ we document suggests the need for marketing scholars to pay greater attention to the theoretical underpinnings of their metrics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1093","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting metrics and their implications in marketing without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Constructing relevant rankings requires understanding their causal effect on consumer choices. However, this is challenging because rankings are endogenous: consumers pay more attention to highly ranked products, and intermediaries rank the most relevant products at the top. In this paper, I use the first data set with experimental variation in the ranking from a field experiment at Expedia to make three contributions. First, I identify the causal effect of rankings and show that they affect what consumers search, but conditional on search, do not affect purchases. Second, I quantify the effect of rankings using a sequential search model and find an average position effect of $1.92, which is lower than literature estimates obtained without experimental variation. I also use model predictions, data patterns, and a feature of the data set (opaque offers) to show rankings lower search costs, instead of affecting consumer expectations or utility.

We recognize the existence of compatibility constraints and develop a dynamic model in which a consumer makes periodic purchase decisions on whether to adopt/replace a base and/or an add-on product under the expectation of future price, quality, and compatibility. Dynamic and interactive inventory effects are included by allowing consumers to account for the long-term financial implications when planning to switch to a base product that is incompatible with their inventory of add-ons. Applying the model to the consumer purchase history of digital cameras and memory cards from 1998 to 2004, we demonstrate that the inventory of add-ons significantly affects the purchase of base products. This \u201clock-in\u201d effect is enhanced when future prices of add-ons increase. Interestingly, it is more costly for consumers to switch from Sony to other brands than vice versa. In two policy simulations, we explore the impact of alternative compatibility policies. For example, if Sony had not created its proprietary Memory Stick, the market share of its cameras would have been reduced by 6 percentage points. This result provides important insights that leading brands and early movers should implement a proprietary standard.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1080","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and compatibility in product purchasing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One reason for the rise in obesity is consumers\u2019 over-consumption of vice goods such as cookies, crackers, and soft drinks. Some authors have suggested that firms have incentives to make vice goods unhealthier and to encourage over-consumption. There are calls for regulations to ensure that firms make such products healthier by reducing harmful ingredients and provide nutritional information. Furthermore, public policy makers have begun to educate consumers to avoid over-consumption by using strategies such as pre-purchase planning. In this paper, we investigate how firms selling vice goods should respond to the growing concerns about obesity. We analyze how firms should adjust prices and product design to cater to consumers with self-control problems and obesity concerns. We use the literature on hyperbolic discounting to model consumers with self-control problems. In this framework, we examine how the unhealthiness of vice goods affects prices, firm\u2019s profits, consumer surplus, and public health. In addition, we study how public policy efforts to encourage pre-purchase planning impact firm\u2019s profits and consumers. Our results show that unlike standard goods, for vice goods a decrease in quality (i.e., increase in unhealthiness) and an increase in price can serve as a self-control device and increase demand. Therefore, firms sometimes can charge higher prices and make more profits by producing unhealthier products. Interestingly, producing unhealthier products can sometimes increase consumer surplus and improve public health. We also show that as the proportion of consumers who use pre-purchase planning increases, firms should respond by raising prices. In such situations, consumer surplus and public health improve but firm\u2019s profits decline. These results have important implications for restaurants and firms that sell vice goods and for public policy makers who aim to combat obesity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1082","","MKS","Marketing","5","['public health', 'obesity', 'consumer surplus', 'self-control', 'regulations']","The article addresses public health concerns related to obesity and the role of regulations in promoting healthier product designs, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility.

Historically, display advertising impressions have been sold through prenegotiated contracts, known as reservation contracts, between publishers and advertisers. In recent years, a growing number of impressions are being sold in real-time bidding (RTB), where advertisers bid for impressions in real time, as consumers visit publishers\u2019 websites. RTB allows advertisers to target consumers at an individual level using browser cookie information, and enables them to customize their ads for each individual. The rapid growth of RTB has created new challenges for advertisers and publishers on how much budget and ad inventory to allocate to RTB. In this paper, we use a game theory model with two advertisers and a publisher to study the effects of RTB on advertisers\u2019 and publishers\u2019 strategies and their profits. We show that symmetric advertisers use asymmetric strategies where one advertiser buys all of his impressions in RTB, whereas the other advertiser focuses on reservation contracts. Interestingly, we find that while both advertisers benefit from the existence of RTB, the advertiser that focuses on reservation contracts benefits more than the advertiser that focuses on RTB. We show that while RTB lowers the equilibrium price of impressions in reservation contracts, it increases the publisher\u2019s total revenue. Despite many analysts\u2019 belief that, because of being more efficient, RTB will replace reservation contracts in the future, we show that publishers have to sell a sufficiently large fraction of their impressions in reservation contracts to maximize their revenue. We extend our model to consider premium consumers, publisher\u2019s uncertainty about the number of future visitors, and effectiveness of ad customization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2017.1083","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of real-time bidding in advertising without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Because of the presence of multiple shoppers from the same household, we also extend the concept of household-level state dependence to consider state dependence at the individual level. We apply our model to five different grocery categories. We find that the intrahousehold heterogeneity in estimated brand intercepts and (to a lesser extent) price sensitivities is about 20%\u201330% of the interhousehold heterogeneity in these parameters. However, with promotion sensitivities, we find intrahousehold heterogeneity, in most cases, to be as large as interhousehold heterogeneity. Our state dependence results show that past brands purchased by an individual have a much stronger influence on subsequent purchases than those purchased by anyone in the household.

While the literature has provided insights into the design of the partial-refund policy, little attention has been directed at the design of the quota-based return policy. Accordingly, this paper explores the relative preference of a quota-based policy vis-\u00e0-vis a partial-refund policy. We do this, first, in the context of risk-neutral channel partners to identify the strategic decisions of each party and the effect of demand uncertainty on the variation of their respective profits. Our results reveal that the manufacturer faces higher profit variation (between the different demand realizations) under the quota policy. The variance in profits for the reseller is, however, higher under the partial-refund policy. We explain the source of profit variations by comparing it across different channel structures (centralized and decentralized). Next, we formally extend the model to include a disutility associated with profit variation and show that when the manufacturer has a variation-induced disutility, the partial-refund contract should be used, as it is the dominating contract. Similarly, when the retailer has a variation-induced disutility, the quota contract should be used. This is consistent with the pattern of profit variations in the risk-neutral case where the manufacturer has lower variation with the partial-refund contract while the reseller has lower variation with the quota contract. Finally, our analysis also shows how the manufacturer may employ a combination policy to better manage its own profit variation while providing adequate overstocking protection for the reseller.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1094","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of return policies and profit variations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, one phenomenon remains understudied: the association between innovation and stock market bubbles. Bubbles\u2014defined as rapid increases and subsequent declines in stock prices\u2014have been primarily examined by economists who generally do not focus on individual characteristics of innovations or on the consequences of bubbles for their parent firms. We set out to fill this gap in our paper. Using a sample of 51 major innovations introduced between 1825 and 2000, we test for bubbles in the stock prices of parent firms subsequent to the commercialization of these innovations. We identify bubbles in 73% of the cases. The magnitude of these bubbles increases with the radicalness of innovations, with their potential to generate indirect network effects, and with their public visibility at the time of commercialization. Moreover, we find that parent firms typically raise new equity capital during bubble periods and that the amount of equity raised is proportional to the magnitude of the bubble. Finally, we show that the buy-and-hold abnormal returns of parent firms are significantly positive between the beginning and the end of the bubble, suggesting that these innovations add value to their firm and to the economy, in spite of the bubble. Our findings have important implications for managers interested in commercializing innovations and for policy makers concerned with the stability of the financial system.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1095","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of stock market bubbles related to innovations without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

One surprising empirical finding is that consumers often believe bundle frames provide greater value than equivalent unbundle frames ($10 > $9 + $1) despite equal all-inclusive prices. Although these context or framing effects appear irrational in isolation, the bundle-framing effect might reflect market relationships caused by underlying seller motives. We show that bundling can signal information about product appeal, that is, popularity. Specifically, only sellers of wide-appeal (popular) add-ons (e.g., well-liked entertainment, sought-after hotel amenities, standard side salads, popular excursions) have an incentive to bundle their add-ons with their core products (e.g., flights, hotel rooms, restaurant entr\u00e9es, cruise trips). By contrast, sellers of narrow-appeal (niche) add-ons (e.g., unorthodox entertainment, unpopular amenities, exotic side salads, unusual excursions) find that bundling is undesirable because they lose core revenue. Consequently, bundling can convey information about horizontally differentiated markets even when the total all-inclusive price equals that of unbundling. Perhaps some presumed consumer biases can reveal market relationships.

A MAP policy imposes a lower bound on advertised prices, subjecting violating retailers to punishments such as termination of distribution agreements. Despite this threat, violations are common. I uncover two key elements to improve compliance: customization to the online environment and credible monitoring and punishments. I analyze the pricing, enforcement, and channel management policies of a manufacturer over several years. During this period, new channel policies take effect, providing a quasi-experiment. The new policies lead to substantially fewer violations. With improved compliance, channel prices increase by 2% without loss in volume. The reduction in violations is particularly stark among authorized retailers with lower sales volume, those that previously operated unapproved websites, and those that have received violation notifications for the specific product before. Moreover, low service providers improve their service. At the same time, there is an increase in opportunistic behavior among top retailers, or retailers that received notifications for other products, and for less popular products via deep discounting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1092","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing policies and compliance among retailers without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

These ads often generate externalities and their exposure is uncertain, impacting advertising effectiveness across publishers. We analyze the inefficiencies created by externalities and uncertainty when information is symmetric between advertisers and publishers, in contrast to most previous research that assumes information asymmetry. Although these inefficiencies cannot be resolved through publisher-side actions, attribution methods that measure campaign uncertainty can serve as alternative solutions to help advertisers adjust their strategies. Attribution creates a virtual competition between publishers, resulting in a team compensation problem. The equilibrium may potentially increase the aggressiveness of advertiser bidding, leading to increased advertiser profits. The popular last-touch method is shown to overincentivize ad exposures, often resulting in lower advertiser profits. The Shapley value achieves an increase in profits compared with the last-touch method. Popular publishers and those that appear early in the conversion funnel benefit the most from advertisers using last-touch attribution. The increase in advertiser profits comes at the expense of total publisher profits and often results in decreased ad allocation efficiency.

We study this phenomenon in the context of both sponsored search advertising and display advertising. Ads are sold through auctions, and when exclusivity is allowed, the seller accepts two bids from advertisers, where one bid is for the standard display format in which multiple advertisers are displayed, and the other bid is for being shown exclusively (therefore they are called two-dimensional, or 2D, auctions). We identify two opposing forces at play in an auction that provides the exclusive placement option\u2014allowing more flexible expression of preferences through bidding for exclusivity increases competition among advertisers, leading to higher bids, which increases the seller\u2019s revenue (between-advertiser competition effect), but it also gives advertisers the incentive to shade their bids for their nonpreferred outcomes, which decreases the seller\u2019s revenue (within-advertiser competition effect). Depending on which effect is stronger, the revenue may increase or decrease. We find that the 2D generalized second price (GSP2D) auction, which is an extension of the widely used generalized second price (GSP) auction and on which currently used auctions for exclusive placement are based, may lead to higher or lower revenue under different parametric conditions. Paradoxically, the revenue from allowing exclusive placement decreases as bidders have higher valuations for exclusive placement. We verify several key implications from our analysis of GSP2D using data from Bing for over 100,000 auctions. As a possible solution (applicable to both sponsored search and display advertising), we show that using VCG2D, which is the adaptation of the Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves (VCG) auction for the 2D setting, guarantees weakly higher revenue when exclusive display is allowed. This is because it induces truthful bidding, which alleviates the problem of bid shading due to the within-advertiser competition effect.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1098","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of online advertising auctions without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Owing to consumer attrition caused by overdraft fees and potential government regulations to reform these fees, financial institutions have become motivated to investigate their overdraft fee structures. Banks need to balance the revenue generated from overdraft fees with consumer dissatisfaction and potential churn caused by these fees. However, no empirical research has been conducted to explain consumer responses to overdraft fees or to evaluate alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees. In this research, we propose a dynamic structural model with consumer monitoring costs and dissatisfaction associated with overdraft fees. We apply the model to an enterprise-level data set of more than 500,000 accounts with a history of 450 days, providing a total of 200 million transactions. We find that consumers heavily discount the future and potentially overdraw because of impulsive spending. However, we also find that high monitoring costs hinder consumers\u2019 effort to track their balance accurately; consequently, consumers may overdraw because of rational inattention. The large data set is necessary because of the infrequent nature of overdrafts; however, it also engenders computational challenges, which we address by using parallel computing techniques. Our policy simulations show that alternative pricing strategies may increase bank revenue and improve consumer welfare. Fixed bill schedules and overdraft waiver programs may also enhance social welfare.

To examine this issue, we utilize a self-signaling model that accounts for the complex process in which a resolution seeker manages his self-control perceptions. Specifically, we employ a planner\u2013doer model wherein a consumer oscillates between long-term resolution planning and short-term implementation: during each implementation juncture, the consumer must determine whether to lapse or use the program as planned, a decision that affects his self-control perceptions in subsequent periods of long-term resolution planning. Using this framework, we derive many significant marketing insights for self-improvement programs, products which assist the pursuit of long-term resolutions. First, we demonstrate that the seller tailors its contract strategy because of self-signaling, the process whereby the decision maker manages his self-control perceptions. Furthermore, we determine that the seller\u2019s program contract depends on the level of noise in self-signaling: when the consumer\u2019s program-use decisions reveal his general level of self-restraint, the seller imposes relatively high per-usage rates; on the other hand, the firm levies low usage fees when implementation decisions depend on short-term fluctuations in self-control. Additionally, we examine program quality as a strategic decision. We determine that the firm offers additional frills when self-signaling is noisy and provides minimal benefits when self-signaling is more informative. Finally, we analyze program length as a marketing strategy and show that lengthy contracts transpire when usage decisions do not sufficiently reveal self-control.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1107","","MKS","Marketing","2","['self-improvement', 'self-control', 'consumer']","The article primarily focuses on marketing strategies related to consumer behavior and self-signaling, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We formulate and estimate a model in which (1) such fixed costs limit the number of different products considered and (2) consumers use prices to screen a product in and out of their consideration set. Our structural estimation finds that the consumer incurs fixed costs of $0.81 to consider a product. These costs are increased by 280% if she has not purchased the product for a year and are decreased by 59% when the product is featured in the store; the dependence of fixed costs on information shifters suggests that these costs are incurred because of consideration. Consideration being scarce at the shelf, firms compete fiercely for customers: We simulate counterfactual markups in a world full of feature advertising and find that firms enjoy higher equilibrium markups because the provision of information softens competition for consideration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1108","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Recommendation contexts also generate big-data problems stemming from data volume, variety, and veracity, as in our setting, which includes massive textual and numerical data. We therefore develop a novel stochastic variational Bayesian framework to achieve fast, scalable, and accurate estimation in such big-data settings and apply it to a MovieLens data set of movie ratings and semantic tags.

We show the existence of a range of royalty rates under which firms could potentially reach a beneficial licensing agreement.

Model estimation at its minimum only requires panel data on firm presence, yet it quantifies important market primitives, such as toughness of competition and entry costs. I provide a step-by-step illustration of the estimation approach by applying it to the Dutch retail grocery industry, in which chain stores slowly replace local stores.

In the U.S. market, the total number of mobile wireless connections has grown from 279.6 million in 2008 to 396 million in 2016. All the firms in this market offer consumers an option of purchasing either an individual plan or a family plan. Whereas a menu of individual plans can be thought of as a means to segment the market, the theoretical challenge is to understand how a firm stands to benefit from adding family plans to its product mix. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to explore the role of family plans. Interestingly, we find that even when a family plan does not draw in any new consumers, a firm can still benefit from offering these plans. This occurs primarily because a family plan enables the firm to price discriminate more effectively. In particular, because some consumers can bundle themselves and join a family plan, the firm is able to charge a higher price to single high-valuation consumers who are unable to be part of a family. Furthermore, the presence of a family plan can have a negative impact on the plan offered to single low-valuation consumers who now have to pay a higher overage price. We also show that not all family plans are profitable and that the profitability depends on the sizes of different types of families.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2018.1121","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the profitability of family plans in telecommunications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that individuals who generate a business idea form biased evaluations of the economic potential of ideas, be it their own idea or somebody else\u2019s idea. On the one hand, they are overconfident about the value of, and overly likely to invest in, their own idea. On the other hand, when investing in another person\u2019s idea, even if it is not competing with their own idea, they are underconfident about the value of, and insufficiently likely to invest in, the idea. Surprisingly, we find that entrepreneurial experience exacerbates this pattern of over- and underconfidence. In addition, we find that the threat that another investor can appropriate a declined investment opportunity increases willingness to invest. We propose a theoretical account to explain the observed pattern of over- and underconfidence in imitative and innovative entrepreneurship. Our findings challenge the traditional account that lowering the cost of imitation has a disincentive effect on the investment decisions of pioneer entrepreneurs and provide evidence that a more lenient appropriability regime may, unexpectedly, have positive effects on entrepreneurship.

We consider generation patterns and intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system. We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments.

We find that this bias strictly decreases firms\u2019 profits when investors do not have an abandonment option, but different results emerge when we allow the investors to divest in the interim. Specifically, a conservative accounting regime may increase the likelihood of projects being discontinued, inducing some firms to exit from the product market and leaving rivals to capture their market share. A conservative regime can thus soften market competition and result in ex ante higher investment payoff, higher consumer surplus, and higher total social welfare. Since industries often have common reporting standards, we also identify the degrees of industry-wide accounting bias that maximize the expected investor payoffs.

The cumulative prospect theory (CPT) explains violations such as the Allais paradoxes and fourfold pattern of risk attitudes as resulting from nonlinear probability transformations. Here we show that the classical paradoxes for decisions under risk can be explained with preferences that are linear in probabilities for any choice set and that maximize an expected-utility function with respect to an endogenous target return. We introduce the maximin payoff as a plausible and even natural target return from a choice set and show that the resulting target-adjusted utility (TAU) model explains additional empirical observations such as the scale dependence of the Allais paradox that cannot be explained by standard specifications of CPT.

Popular risk measures such as variance and value-at-risk have been found inadequate because we now give more importance to properties such as monotonicity, convexity, translation invariance, positive homogeneity, and law invariance. Unfortunately, the challenge remains that it is unclear how to choose a risk measure that faithfully represents a decision maker\u2019s true risk attitude. In this work, we show that one can account precisely for (neither more nor less than) what we know of the risk preferences of an investor/policy maker when comparing and optimizing financial positions. We assume that the decision maker can commit to a subset of the above properties (the use of a law invariant convex risk measure for example) and that he can provide a series of assessments comparing pairs of potential risky payoffs. Given this information, we propose to seek financial positions that perform best with respect to the most pessimistic estimation of the level of risk potentially perceived by the decision maker. We present how this preference robust risk minimization problem can be solved numerically by formulating convex optimization problems of reasonable size. Numerical experiments on a portfolio selection problem, where the problem reduces to a linear program, will illustrate the advantages of accounting for the fact that the choice of a risk measure is ambiguous.

In these markets, contract winners (vendors) provide clients with customized products such as computer software, business plans, and artistic designs. The products are used primarily for business purposes and require time for production after project-specific contracts are awarded. These characteristics render it unclear whether online reputation will have similar effects as in online retailing, where finished and standardized products are sold for consumption. We analyze field transaction data from a major online labor market. The analyses using matched contract samples and vendor panels consistently show that despite the governing power provided by contracts as well as the litigation and arbitration options, vendors\u2019 online reputation can still be influential on clients. Vendors who have no reputation ratings are less likely to be chosen, and those with higher ratings are more likely to win subsequent bids. Importantly, however, such influences depend on the contract form that is used for a particular transaction\u2014they are significant in output-based contracts but nonsignificant in input-based contracts. Besides extending the research on online reputation to the markets of customized production, this study shows contract form as an important boundary condition for the effectiveness of reputational information.

The seller has private information on the aggregate inventory level and the inventory composition of two product variants. The seller credibly and discretionarily discloses inventory information to customers either fully or partially, i.e., disclosing the exact inventory of each product variant, the aggregate inventory level, or no information to customers. Customers form expectations of future availability and make rational purchasing decisions accordingly. In the disclosure literature, discretion usually leads to an unraveling result: sellers who learn favorable market information opt to disclose it, making full disclosure the equilibrium. This paper shows that aggregate inventory disclosure, i.e., partial disclosure, can be instead sustained as an ex post equilibrium. We demonstrate that inventory information aggregation arises when there is an ex post desire to reduce supply\u2013demand mismatches in all inventory scenarios. Specifically, when customers\u2019 preferred products are more likely to stock out, the seller could entice more incoming consumers who hope that their desired products are in stock by withholding product composition but disclosing the aggregate inventory level. If customers\u2019 desired products are sold out, the seller can benefit from upselling or cross-selling customers\u2019 less preferred products. Alternatively, when the seller stocks more desired products, aggregate disclosure can dampen the flow of incoming customers and reduce the shortage penalty cost. This result is robust under various settings: risk-averse customers, heterogeneous customers, and horizontally differentiated products.

To understand why it has proven so successful, we develop a theoretical model that exploits the two-sided nature of flights as connectors of supply and demand for goods and services other than traveling itself across physical space. Carriers offer flights of different quality and may sign agreements with suppliers of goods and services at the destination so as to subsidize and foster demand from the carriers\u2019 travelers as in standard two-sided markets. Customers/travelers care about home and destination consumption and about the flight\u2019s quality. Hence, beyond the thickness of the connected sides of the market, the quality of the airline platform has an intrinsic value to travelers. We show that only low-income travelers fly with low-cost airlines, while no-frills carriers are more likely to act as a platform than legacy airlines. We study how the degree of substitution between home and destination consumption affects the equilibrium market structure of the airline industry.

These systems are notoriously difficult to optimize because of the complex structure of the optimal solution and the curse of dimensionality, having resisted solution for over 40 years. Recently, so-called tailored base-surge (TBS) policies have been proposed as a heuristic for the dual-sourcing problem. Under such a policy, a constant order is placed at the regular source in each period, while the order placed at the express source follows a simple order-up-to rule. Numerical experiments by several authors have suggested that such policies perform well as the lead time difference between the two sources grows large, which is exactly the setting in which the curse of dimensionality leads to the problem becoming intractable. However, providing a theoretical foundation for this phenomenon has remained a major open problem. In this paper, we provide such a theoretical foundation by proving that a simple TBS policy is indeed asymptotically optimal as the lead time of the regular source grows large, with the lead time of the express source held fixed. Our main proof technique combines novel convexity and lower-bounding arguments, an explicit implementation of the vanishing discount factor approach to analyzing infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, and ideas from the theory of random walks and queues, significantly extending the methodology and applicability of a novel framework for analyzing inventory models with large lead times recently introduced by Goldberg and coauthors in the context of lost-sales models with positive lead times.

Because the two parties often have conflicting pecuniary incentives, customer trust and supplier trustworthiness play important roles in the success of these interactions. We investigate whether and how the process through which assistance is provided can foster trust and trustworthiness, and thus facilitate better cooperation. We compare three prevalent assistance processes: information sharing, advice provision, and delegation. We propose that, even if the pecuniary incentives of both parties do not vary from one assistance process to another, the assistance process itself impacts the customer\u2019s and supplier\u2019s nonpecuniary motives that give rise to trust and trustworthiness. Consequently, the assistance process affects the level of cooperation and payoffs. We test our behavioral predictions through laboratory experiments based on a retail distribution setting. We quantify the impact of different assistance processes on trust, trustworthiness and channel performance, and identify the underlying drivers of those impacts. Our results offer insight into the role of the assistance process in managing supplier assistance effectively and why certain assistance processes may lead to more successful outcomes than others even if the pecuniary incentives remain unaltered.

Using 1998\u20132006 data on the residential addresses of individual directors, we document that the geographic proximity to headquarters of audit committees and other monitoring committees declined upon implementation of the mandates. The decrease in proximity was especially large for those firms that were both SOX noncompliant and supply constrained in local director labor markets at the time the reforms were enacted. Moreover, firms with larger SOX-related losses of director proximity experienced significantly greater post-SOX declines in earnings quality.

Misreporting firms pay greater loan spreads than matched firms for at least six years following revelation of the misreporting, and there is no evidence of a downward trend in the misreporting premium. Following revelation, misreporting firms are more likely to engage in various actions to potentially rebuild their reputations, but even firms that engage in multiple actions continue to pay greater loan spreads for at least six years. Our results suggest that misreporting causes long-lasting and costly reputation losses that firms find very difficult or prohibitively costly to restore.

As a consequence, reputational concerns may induce the certifier to reduce information quality, thus depressing welfare. The entry of a second certifier impacts reputational incentives: when sellers only solicit one certifier, competition plays a disciplining role and the region where reputation is bad shrinks.

These platforms contract with advertisers to provide a certain number of impressions on mobile apps in their desired sets of geographic locations (usually cities or zip codes) within their desired time durations (for example, a month); the execution of each such a contract is referred to as a campaign. To fulfill the demands of the campaigns, the platform bids in real time at an ad exchange to win mobile impressions arising over the desired sets of locations of the campaigns and then allocates the acquired impressions among the ongoing campaigns.

Our analysis in this paper offers near-optimal policies for both a static model and a dynamic model of campaign arrivals. The static model represents a subscription-based setting, where customers provide information of their campaigns in advance to the platform. The dynamic model represents a setting where campaigns arrive randomly and the platform reacts to these arrivals in real time; for this model, our rolling-horizon policy periodically recomputes the platform\u2019s procurement (or bidding) and allocation decisions. We establish performance bounds on our policies for both models and demonstrate the attractiveness of these bounds on real data.

User-generated content has become an important information source. The vast variety and volume of user-generated content makes firms better informed about consumers (precision-improving effect), and the common and public nature of user-generated content makes firms\u2019 information more correlated (correlation-increasing effect). We examine the impact of user-generated content in a setting in which two competing firms that are uncertain about consumer location or valuation design and sell horizontally differentiated products. We find that user-generated content has very different implications for competing firms\u2019 location decisions and quality decisions. When firms are uncertain about consumer taste and choose their product locations, whether firms and/or consumers benefit from the user-generated content depends on which of the two effects dominates. We find that only when the correlation-increasing effect is moderate, a win\u2013win scenario for both firms and consumers occurs, but the society always benefits from user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference strengthens the overall impact of user-generated content. In sharp contrast, when firms face uncertain consumer valuation of quality and choose product quality, they do not benefit from user-generated content, but consumers may benefit or lose from it. When the correlation-increasing effect is significant, both firms and consumers, and therefore the society, are hurt by user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference mitigates the negative impact but amplifies the positive impact of user-generated content in this case.

High-powered incentives in the workplace tend to increase output, but it is unknown whether this masks crowding out. This paper uses a within-subject experimental design and finds evidence that crowding out also extends to high-powered incentives in a real work setting with paid workers.

Agents\u2019 assets might be insufficient to satisfy their liabilities, leading to defaults. In case of default, bankruptcy rules are used to specify the way agents are going to be rationed. A clearing payment matrix is a payment matrix consistent with the prevailing bankruptcy rules that satisfies limited liability and priority of creditors. Since clearing payment matrices and the corresponding values of equity are not uniquely determined, we provide bounds on the possible levels equity can take. Unlike the existing literature, which studies centralized clearing procedures, we introduce a large class of decentralized clearing processes. We show the convergence of any such process in finitely many iterations to the least clearing payment matrix. When the unit of account is sufficiently small, all decentralized clearing processes lead essentially to the same value of equity as a centralized clearing procedure. As a policy implication, it is not necessary to collect and process all the sensitive data of all the agents simultaneously and run a centralized clearing procedure.

Our methodology relies on the partition of the objective function into separate low-dimensional dynamic programming (DP) models, each of which can be equivalently represented as a shortest-path problem in an underlying state-transition graph. We show that the associated transition graphs can be related by a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) so as to produce exact solutions to the original nonlinear problem. To address DPs with large state spaces, we present a general relaxation mechanism that dynamically aggregates states during the construction of the transition graphs. The resulting MILP provides both lower and upper bounds to the nonlinear function, and it may be embedded in branch-and-bound procedures to find provably optimal solutions. We describe how to specialize our technique for structured objectives (e.g., submodular functions) and consider three problems arising in revenue management, portfolio optimization, and healthcare.

Dates of death of relatives and close friends of 33 French artists and 15 American artists were gathered from electronic sources and biographies, and information on over 15,000 paintings was collected from the Blouin Art Sales Index and the online collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art, the J.

Scholars have recently proposed the potential of designing multidimensional rating systems to better convey information on multiple dimensions of products. This study investigates whether and how multidimensional rating systems affect consumer satisfaction (measured by product ratings), based on both observational data and two randomized experiments. Our identification strategy of the observational study hinges on a natural experiment on TripAdvisor when the website started to allow consumers to rate multiple dimensions of the restaurants, as opposed to only providing an overall rating, in January 2009. We further obtain rating data on the same set of restaurants from Yelp, which controls for the unobserved restaurant quality over time and allows us to identify the causal effect using a difference-in-differences approach. Results from the econometric analyses show that ratings in a single-dimensional rating system have a downward trend and a higher dispersion, whereas ratings in a multidimensional rating system are significantly higher and convergent. Findings from two randomized experiments suggest that the multidimensional rating system helps consumers find products that better fit their preferences and increases the confidence of their choices. We also show that the observed results cannot be explained by the priming effect due to rating system interface or a list of other alternative explanations. The combined evidence from the natural experiment and randomized experiments support the view that the multidimensional rating system enhances rating informativeness and provide implications for designing online rating systems that help consumers match their preferences with product attributes.

An important question the provider faces under such circumstances is whether or not to perform triage and how to prioritize the patients. By choosing to triage a particular patient, the provider can determine the health condition and thus the urgency of the patient, but that will come at the expense of delaying the actual service (stabilization or initial treatment) for that patient as well as all the other patients. Motivated by this problem, which also arises in other service contexts, we consider a service system where finitely many patients, all available at time zero, belong to one of the two possible triage classes, where each class is characterized by its waiting cost and expected service time. Patients\u2019 class identities are initially unknown, but the service provider has the option to spend time on triage to determine the class of a patient. Our objective is to identify policies that balance the time spent on triage with the time spent on service by minimizing the total expected cost. We provide a complete characterization of the optimal dynamic policy and show that the optimal dynamic policy that specifies when to perform triage is determined by a switching curve, and we provide a mathematical expression for this curve. One insight that comes out of this characterization is that the server should start with performing triage when there are sufficiently many patients and never perform triage when there are few patients. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which we demonstrate how one can use our mathematical results to develop policies that can be used in mass-casualty triage and prioritization, and we find that there are substantial benefits to using one of these policies instead of the simpler benchmarks.

Although best practices and guidelines for constructing good formulations abound, there is rarely a single systematic construction approach that leads to the best possible formulation. Here, we introduce embedding formulations and complexity as a new MIP formulation paradigm for systematically constructing formulations for disjunctive constraints that are optimal with respect to size. More specifically, they yield the smallest possible ideal formulation (i.e., one whose LP relaxation has integral extreme points) among all formulations that only use 0-1 auxiliary variables. We use the paradigm to characterize optimal formulations for special ordered sets of type 2 and certain piecewise linear functions of two variables. We also show that the resultant formulations can provide a significant computational advantage over all known formulations for piecewise linear functions.

State genetic privacy regimes employ and combine up to three alternative approaches to protecting patient privacy: Rules requiring that an individual is notified about potential privacy risks; rules restricting discriminatory usage of genetic data by employers or insurance companies; and rules limiting redisclosure without the consent of the individual. We find empirically that approaches to genetic and health privacy that give users control over redisclosure encourage the spread of genetic testing, but that notification deters individuals from obtaining genetic tests. We present some evidence that the latter reflects costs imposed on the supply of genetic testing by hospitals. We find no effects of state genetic antidiscrimination laws on genetic testing rates.

Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot-hand literature, which has generally found either no hot hand or a very weak hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for transferring defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players, whereas baseball does not. We then develop a method to test whether baseball teams do respond appropriately to hot opponents.

We test this prediction by using a measure of investor overconfidence derived from the characteristics and holdings of U.S. equity mutual fund managers. We find that firms with more overconfident investors are relatively overvalued based on the market-to-book ratio and a misvaluation measure. The result is stronger among stocks with greater mutual fund ownership, particularly by active mutual funds. Firms with more overconfident investors also exhibit lower subsequent stock returns, issue more equity, and invest more.

This paper tests whether Chapter 11 restructuring outcomes are affected by time constraints in busy bankruptcy courts. Using the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act as an exogenous shock to caseloads, I find that commercial banks report lower charge-offs on business lending when court caseloads decline, suggesting that the costs of financial distress are lower in less-congested courts. Further, court caseload affects how restructuring takes place. Less-busy bankruptcy judges liquidate fewer small firms, but more large firms. When caseload declines, large firms spend less time in court and firms that are dismissed from court are less likely to refile for bankruptcy. In addition, firms are less likely to sell assets or obtain debtor-in-possession financing in less-busy courts. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2808.

In six experiments, we show that risky options used in previous research paradigms often attained uncertainty via adding an unexplained transaction feature (e.g., purchasing a coin flip or lottery), and behavior that appears to reflect risk aversion could instead reflect an aversion to weird transactions. Specifically, willingness to pay drops just as much when adding risk to a transaction as when adding unexplained features. Holding transaction features constant, adding additional risk does not further reduce willingness to pay. We interpret our work as generalizing ambiguity aversion to riskless choice.

In this setting, the seller could potentially extract the entire buyer surplus by running efficient auctions and charging an upfront participation fee at the beginning of the horizon. In some markets, such as Internet advertising, participation fees are not practical since buyers expect to inspect items before purchasing them. This motivates us to study the design of dynamic mechanisms under successively more stringent requirements that capture the implicit business constraints of these markets. We first consider a periodic individual rationality constraint, which limits the mechanism to charge at most the buyer\u2019s value in each period. While this prevents large upfront participation fees, the seller can still design mechanisms that spread a participation fee across multiple initial auctions. These mechanisms have the unappealing feature that they provide close-to-zero buyer utility in earlier auctions in exchange for higher utility in later auctions. To address this problem, we introduce a martingale utility constraint, which imposes the requirement that from the perspective of the buyer, the next item\u2019s expected utility is equal to the present one\u2019s. Our main result is providing a dynamic auction satisfying martingale utility and periodic individual rationality whose loss in profit with respect to first-best (full extraction of buyer surplus) is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. The proposed mechanism is a dynamic two-tier auction with a hard floor and a soft floor that allocates the item whenever the buyer\u2019s bid is above the hard floor and charges the minimum of the bid and the soft floor.

While both ABM and lab experiments have similar aims\u2014to identify the rules, tendencies, and heuristics by which individual agents make decisions and respond to external stimuli\u2014they work toward their common goal in notably different ways. Behavioral-lab research typically exposes human subjects to experimental manipulations, or treatments, to make causal inferences by observing variation in response to the treatment. ABM researchers ascribe individual simulated \u201cagents\u201d with decision rules describing their behavior and subsequently attempt to replicate \u201cmacro\u201d level empirical patterns. Integration of ABM and lab experiments presents advantages for both sets of researchers. ABM researchers will benefit from exposure to a larger set of empirically validated mechanisms that can add nuance and refinement to their models of human behavior and system dynamics. Lab-oriented researchers will gain from ABM a method for assessing the validity and magnitude of their findings, adjudicating between competing mechanisms, developing new theory to test in the lab, and exploring macro-level, long-run implications of subtle, micro-level observations that can be difficult to observe in the field.

A recent innovation in cloud computing, known as autoscaling, allows companies to automatically scale their computational load up or down to match customer demand. We build a game theory model to examine how autoscaling will affect firms\u2019 decisions to enter a new market and the resulting equilibrium prices, profitability, and consumer surplus. The model produces novel results depending on the likelihood of a firm\u2019s success in the new market, differentiation among potential entrants, and the cost of computational capacity. For instance, in contrast to previous capacity commitment models with demand certainty, we show that autoscaling can mitigate price competition if the likelihood of a firm\u2019s success in the market is moderate and the cost of capacity is sufficiently low. This is because without autoscaling, the firms\u2019 uncertainty about demand would lead to excessive computational capacities and thus aggressive price competition. We also find that when the likelihood of success is sufficiently high, autoscaling facilitates entry for one firm yet deters a second firm from simultaneously entering the market.

For instance, CVS dropped tobacco products from its shelves in 2014, while Aldi dropped confectionery from its checkout lines in 2016. Findings from consumers\u2019 evaluation of such moves suggest there exists a negative market spillover from selling in a market, such that a firm\u2019s participation in one market reduces consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for the firm\u2019s products in other markets. On the other hand, certain socially favorable markets, such as markets for environment-friendly products, have been shown to create a positive market spillover for their sellers, increasing consumers\u2019 willingness to pay in other markets the sellers participate in. We build an analytical model of two competing firms to examine how firms react to a market spillover and find the conditions under which different firms would sell in the spillover-producing market. Our analysis of how firms\u2019 profits are affected by market spillovers identifies the consumers\u2019 reservation value in the spillover-producing market, the relative size of the two markets, and the extent of the market spillover as key factors determining which firms benefit from a market spillover. Interestingly, we find it is possible for both firms to make more profit with a negative market spillover compared to when there is no market spillover, while a positive market spillover can actually result in lower profits for both firms compared to no market spillover.

More specifically, we test if online social networks compete with content providers or instead play a complementary role by promoting and attracting traffic to external websites. During the outage, consistent with a promotional effect, we observe a significant decrease in traffic and unique visitors to the news website lasting beyond the outage hours. We further find that direct referrals from Facebook links grossly underestimated the actual impact of Facebook in generating traffic. Instead, during the outage, we observe a more significant reduction in visitors arriving at the news website from search engines or directly typing the website URL or using bookmarks. Additionally, readership of articles and types of pages viewed also changed during the outage. Although we observe a drop in news consumption during the outage hours for all news categories, the subsequent news consumption differs across categories. Time sensitive categories like sports and local news see an increase in consumption, whereas news on women issues or health topics see a decrease. Analysis of individual-level visit and readership behavior during the outage also reveals that Facebook not only introduces selectivity bias by attracting shallower readers but also changes readership patterns (in the absence of Facebook, visitors engage in more in-depth reading). To test the generalizability of our results, we study the impact of the outage on referrals from other social media outlets, on other news sites, and on other content and e-commerce sites. We find similar effects on other news providers, whereas data from nonnews sites, including e-commerce, show no major outage effects. Overall, our results have important managerial implications.

EPR is typically implemented in a collective system, where a network of recycling resources are coordinated to fulfill the EPR obligations of a set of producers, and the resulting system cost is allocated among these producers. Collective EPR is prevalent because of its cost efficiency advantages. However, it is considered to provide inferior design incentives compared to an individual implementation (where producers fulfill their EPR obligations individually). In this paper, we revisit this assertion and investigate its fundamental underpinnings in a network setting. To this end, we develop a new biform game framework that captures producers\u2019 independent design choices (noncooperative stage) and recognizes the need to maintain the voluntary participation of producers for the collective system to be stable (cooperative stage). This biform game subsumes the network-based operations of a collective system and captures the interdependence between producers\u2019 product design and participation decisions. We then characterize the manner in which design improvement may compromise stability and vice versa. We establish that a stable collective EPR implementation can match and even surpass an individual implementation with respect to product design outcomes. In particular, we show that when the processing technology efficiency and product recyclability are substitutes (complements), a recycling network where processor capacity pooling leads to sufficiently low (high) cost reduction will lead to superior designs in the collective system and maintain its stability, and we propose cost allocation mechanisms to achieve this dual purpose.

We address this question by exploiting the widespread media attention highlighting racial bias among professional basketball referees that occurred in May 2007 following the release of an academic study. Using new data, we confirm that racial bias persisted in the years after the study\u2019s original sample but prior to the media coverage. Subsequent to the media coverage, though, the bias disappeared. Several potential mechanisms may have produced this result, including voluntary behavior changes by individual referees, adjustments by players to new information, and changes in referee behavior due to institutional pressure.

We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement\u2014defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs\u2014with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality\u2014like humor and emotion\u2014is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content\u2014like mentions of price and deals\u2014is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality\u2013related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers\u2019 path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook\u2019s EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook\u2019s behavioral targeting.

Managing the speed-versus-quality trade-off in such systems presents a unique challenge because of the interplay between agent knowledge and flow of work between the two levels. We develop a novel model of agent knowledge, based on the beta distribution, and deploy it in a partially observable Markov decision process model to describe the optimal policy for deciding which cases (patients) to refer to the second level for further evaluation. We show that this policy has a monotone control-limit structure that reduces the fraction of decisions made at the upper level as workload increases. Because the optimal policy is complex, we use structural insights from it to design two practical heuristics. These heuristics enable an HKBSS to adapt efficiently to workload shifts by adjusting the criteria for referring decisions to the upper level based on partial real-time queue length information. Finally, we conduct analytic and numerical analyses to derive insights into the management of a TPT system. We find that (1) the telemedical physician should evaluate more patients as congestion in the emergency room waiting area increases; (2) training that improves accuracy of the physician and/or nurses can be effective even if it only does so for a single patient type, but training that improves consistency must do so for all patient types to be effective; and (3) patient classification in triage should consider environmental and operational conditions in addition to the patient\u2019s medical condition.

On the one hand, a retailer benefits by entry since the second distribution channel enables it to reach new customers, giving it a leg up on rivals. On the other hand, physical entry typically compels the retailer to start collecting sales taxes even for online transactions, making its consumers particularly price sensitive. This paper examines this trade-off to characterize a retailer\u2019s entry decision, as well as the market-level equilibrium of bricks-and-mortar penetration. The paper then layers in supply market considerations\u2014namely, the retailer\u2019s procurement of products from upstream suppliers. The analysis demonstrates that sales taxes not only reduce the consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for products in the retail market, but also dampen the retailer\u2019s willingness to pay for the products in the wholesale arena.

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model of team leadership of coproductive projects and study how team leaders should combine their directing and contributing efforts depending on the team and project characteristics. Our analysis reveals that two types of team leadership approaches arise in equilibrium, namely, \u201cparticipatory\u201d team leadership, under which the team leader gives the team members full discretion on their choice of effort, and \u201cdirective\u201d team leadership, under which the team leader demands team members exert higher effort than what they would choose to exert voluntarily. We find that directive team leadership is optimal when the team members have low incentives, that is, when their rewards are low, the size of the team is large, or failure is not too costly (e.g., continuation is possible); otherwise, participatory team leadership is optimal. Moreover, we show that a higher degree of effort complementarity (as in innovative projects) leads to greater alignment between the team leader\u2019s and team members\u2019 contributing efforts, which, under directive team leadership, also implies greater alignment between the team leader\u2019s directing and contributing efforts. Finally, the team leader should set the team size and team members\u2019 rewards in a way that accentuates the difference between the two team leadership approaches. That is, under directive team leadership, she should set a large team size and offer the team members low rewards whereas under participatory team leadership she should set a small team size and offer the team members high rewards.

After a plausibly exogenous shock to managerial reporting liability, cautious CEO firms exhibit a 35% larger reduction in unreported R&D relative to confident CEO firms.

The effects of uncertainty vary significantly by firm size. When faced with high price uncertainty, large firms increase their hedging intensity but do not lower capital investment or debt issuance. In contrast, small firms do not adjust their hedging intensity but significantly lower capital expenditure and debt issuance even after controlling for investment demand. Moreover, the negative effect of uncertainty on capital investment is significantly weaker for firms that hedge their output price risk. Our analysis highlights that, in the presence of financial frictions, high price uncertainty has significant dampening effects on capital investment of small firms by exacerbating their financial constraints, and that this negative effect is amplified by firm-level constraints on ability to hedge risk exposures.

The negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and expected returns, or idiosyncratic volatility puzzle, exists only for stocks with high MAX, implying that the puzzle may arise from the overpayment for stocks with high MAX and the subsequent return reversal. Consistent with the expectation that overpayment will be stronger for overconfident investors, the MAX-premium is larger in countries with high individualism index (IDV) than it is in countries with low IDV. Furthermore, we find the MAX-premium to be larger and the difference in the MAX-premium between high- and low-IDV countries to be more pronounced when VIX and volatility are high. Our findings suggest that the attention-grabbing feature of stocks with high MAX affects the pricing of extreme positive returns asymmetrically depending on the cultural differences across countries.

Especially in developing economies, traditional financing methods can be very costly or unavailable to such suppliers. To reduce channel costs, large buyers have recently begun implementing their own financing methods that intermediate between suppliers and financing institutions. In this paper, we analyze the role and efficiency of buyer intermediation in supplier financing. Building a game-theoretical model, we show that buyer intermediated financing can significantly improve channel performance, and can simultaneously benefit both supply chain participants. Using data from a large Chinese online retailer and through structural regression estimation, we demonstrate that buyer intermediation lowers interest rates and wholesale prices, increases order fill rates, and boosts supplier borrowing. Based on counterfactual analysis on the data, we predict that the implementation of buyer intermediated financing will improve channel profits by 13.05%, increasing supplier and retailer profits by more than 10% each, and yielding approximately $44 million projected savings for the retailer.

Hiring as a Dynamic Experiential Learning Process in an Online Market for Contract Labor","We know a job applicant\u2019s social category affects an employer\u2019s likelihood of hiring the applicant, but we do not know whether, or how, employers update their beliefs regarding these social categories. I portray hiring as a cognitive decision and examine how prior negative and positive hiring experiences of employees from particular countries affect an employer\u2019s subsequent likelihood of hiring applicants from those countries. I hypothesize that employer reactions will reflect loss aversion\u2014that employers will react more strongly to negative hiring experiences than positive ones. Furthermore, I expect that the similarity of the prior job will moderate this effect. Analyses of 3.9 million applications, from freelancers worldwide, for over 290,000 jobs on an online labor market demonstrate that employers are 15% less likely (versus 8% more likely) to hire freelancers from a country following a prior negative (versus positive) experience. Prior negative experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 82% less likely (versus 8% less likely) to hire from that country. Conversely, positive experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 25% more likely (versus 3% more likely) to subsequently hire from that country. The consequences for switching countries, following negative experiences, are analyzed and wage differences to compensate for employer reactions, are calculated.

This creates asymmetric information in the second period whereby a firm knows more about its own past customers than its competitor does. We examine how the ability to offer personalized prices based on customer information affects prices and profit over the two periods. When product differentiation is exogenously fixed, asymmetric information leads to two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive pricing to secure a larger first-period market share. When product differentiation is also chosen endogenously, there continue to exist two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive positioning. The more aggressive firm, whether through pricing or positioning, can force the game to be played to its advantage. But both firms end up worse off compared to when they use simpler pricing strategies or commit to substantial product differentiation.

For a period of 45 consecutive days, a group of randomly selected households who used BitTorrent in the past were gifted with a bundle of TV channels with movies and TV shows that could be streamed as in SVoD. We find that, on average, households that received the gift increased overall TV consumption by 4.6% and reduced Internet downloads and uploads by 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively. However, and also on average, treated households did not change their likelihood of using BitTorrent during the experiment. Our findings are heterogeneous across households and are mediated by the fit between the preferences of households in our sample for movies and the content available as part of the gifted channels. Households with preferences aligned with the gifted content reduced their probability of using BitTorrent during the experiment by 18% and decreased their amount of upload traffic by 45%. We also show using simulation that the size of the SVoD catalog and licensing window restrictions limit significantly the ability of content providers to match SVoD offerings to the preferences of BitTorrent users. Finally, we estimate that households in our sample are willing to pay at most $3.25 USD per month to access a SVoD catalog as large as Netflix\u2019s in the United States. Together, our results show that, as a stand-alone strategy, using legal SVoD to curtail piracy will require, at the minimum, offering content much earlier and at much lower prices than those currently offered in the marketplace, changes that are likely to reduce industry revenue and that may damage overall incentives to produce new content while, at the same time, curbing only a small share of piracy.

Why do we find more collusion in price competition than in quantity competition? Why is collusion so hard to detect? We examine strategic behavior in competitive interactions by developing and applying the concept of virtual bargaining. When decision makers virtually bargain, they mentally simulate, and choose among, agreements that they could reach if they were able to explicitly negotiate with each other. Virtual bargainers focus on agreements that offer some protection against the possibility that their counterparts may deviate and best respond to these agreements. We develop a formal account of virtual bargaining and demonstrate that it leads to collusion in Bertrand, but not in Cournot, competition. In this framework, collusion is a result of virtual bargaining as a mode of reasoning and requires neither communication nor dynamic considerations, such as rewards and punishments, between the players.

Across both studies, our results reveal that groups with at least one female member are significantly better calibrated than all-male groups. This effect is mediated by the extent to which group members share opinions and information during the group discussion. Moreover, we find that compared to a statistical aggregation of individual confidence intervals, group discussions have a neutral or positive effect on the quality of confidence judgments for groups with at least one female group member; in contrast, group discussion actually harms confidence calibration for all-male groups.

The goal is to provide timely evacuation and medical treatment to injured soldiers. The model enforces the \u201cGolden Hour\u201d evacuation doctrine, attempts to maximize the expected number of severely injured soldiers evacuated within one hour without delay, and represents the availability of air ambulances as an endogenous source of uncertainty. The MEDEVAC model is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem whose continuous relaxation is in general nonconvex and for which we develop an algorithmic method articulated around (i) new bounding techniques obtained through the solution of restriction and relaxation problems and (ii) a spatial branch-and-bound algorithm solving conic mixed-integer programs at each node. The computational study, based on data from Operation Enduring Freedom, reveals that the bounding problems can be quickly solved regardless of problem size, the bounds are tight, and the spatial branch-and-bound dominates the CPLEX and BARON solvers in terms of computational time and robustness. Compared to the MEDEVAC myopic policy, our approach increases the number of casualties treated timely and can contribute to reducing the number of deaths on the battlefield. The benefits increase as the MEDEVAC resources become tighter and the combats intensify. The model can be used at the strategic level to design an efficient MEDEVAC system and at the tactical level for intelligent tasking and dispatching.

However, if margin levels are proportional to volatility, then a spike in volatility leads to potentially destabilizing margin calls in times of market stress. Risk-sensitive margin requirements are thus procyclical in the sense that they amplify shocks. We use a GARCH model of volatility and a combination of theoretical and empirical results to analyze how much higher margin levels need to be to avoid procyclicality while reducing counterparty credit risk. Our analysis compares the tail decay of conditional and unconditional loss distributions with comparable stable and risk-sensitive margin requirements. Greater persistence and burstiness in volatility leads to a slower decay in the tail of the unconditional distribution and a higher buffer needed to avoid procyclicality. The tail decay drives other measures of procyclicality as well. Our analysis points to important features of price time series that should inform \u201cantiprocyclicality\u201d measures but are missing from current rules.

We use two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter, the world\u2019s largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests primarily amongst unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. These relationships are corroborated with a first-hand survey conducted with gig-economy service providers.

They presume that people evaluate prospects on the basis of potential outcomes. However, people may often conceptualize prospects in part nonconsequentially. Consider someone evaluating a new, \u201cfocal\u201d prospect given an unresolved \u201cbackground\u201d position to which that person is already exposed. If the two are positively correlated, the individual may conceptualize the focal prospect as a bet \u201cwith\u201d the individual\u2019s background position; if they are negatively correlated, the individual may conceptualize the focal prospect as a bet \u201cagainst\u201d the individual\u2019s background position. Because people like to be consistent, this nonconsequentialist conceptualization may induce a taste for betting \u201cwith\u201d the background position. Such bets constitute risk-seeking doubling down, not risk-averse hedging. Indeed, we observe that relative to corresponding background-less choices, participants with unresolved background positions are relatively risk-seeking, favoring positively rather than negatively correlated focal prospects.

Normative prescriptions to solve this problem have generally ignored behavioral aspects of decision making while behavioral research has paid limited attention to interdependent, multidimensional decisions. We experimentally examine subjects\u2019 performance when they jointly determine price and quantities. We find that subjects systematically deviate from the theoretically optimal price and quantity levels. Contrary to expectation, decomposing the price and quantity decisions does not improve subjects\u2019 decisions. In a series of follow-up experiments, we isolate the effects of (a) interdependence between decisions and (b) demand uncertainty. We show that decisions improve by making subjects more aware of interdependence and by reducing the uncertainty. However, reducing complexity through partial automation of the interdependent dimensions does not improve the decisions made by subjects. We also find that subjects anchor on cost for price decisions and on mean demand potential for quantity decisions, thereby explaining the consistent underpricing and overordering behavior across experiments.

It addresses three important questions: (1) What is the impact of marketing or finance skills on business profits? (2) How do improvements in marketing and finance skills respectively affect different business outcomes? (3) When are increases in marketing relative to finance skills more beneficial? Through a randomized control study of 852 firms in South Africa, the analysis finds significant improvements in profitability from both types of business skills training. However, the pathways to achieve these gains differ substantially between the two groups. The marketing group achieves greater profits by adopting a growth focus on higher sales, greater investments in stock and materials, and hiring more employees. The finance group achieves similar profit gains but through an efficiency focus on lower costs. Both groups show significantly higher adoption of business practices related to their respective training program. Consistent with a growth focus, marketing/sales skills are significantly more beneficial to businesses run by entrepreneurs with ex ante less exposure to different market contexts. In contrast and in line with an efficiency focus, it is the more established businesses that benefit significantly more from finance/accounting skills.

Our paper extends previous work in marketing, for example, Desai and Purohit (2004) by focusing on decentralized markets with a dynamic and fully competitive framework while also considering possible noneconomic aspects of bargaining. We construct and analyze a competitive search model, which allows us to endogenize the expected demand depending on pricing rules and posted prices. Our analysis reveals that fixed and flexible pricing policies generally coexist in the same marketplace, and each policy comes with its own list price and customer demographics. More specifically, if customers dislike haggling, then fixed pricing emerges as the unique equilibrium, but if customers get some additional satisfaction from the bargaining process, then both policies are offered, and the unique equilibrium exhibits full segmentation: haggler customers avoid fixed-price firms and exclusively shop at flexible firms, whereas nonhaggler customers do the opposite. We also find that prices increase in customer satisfaction, implying that sellers take advantage of the positive utility enjoyed by hagglers in the form of higher prices. Finally, considering the presence of seasonal cycles in most markets, we analyze a scenario in which market demand goes through periodic ups and downs and find that equilibrium prices remain mostly stable despite significant fluctuations in demand. This finding suggests a plausible competition-based explanation for the stability of prices. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2922. This paper was accepted by J.

The primes are more effective when they highlight a facet of the potential donor\u2019s identity that we hypothesize to be more relevant to his sense of self: priming identity as a previous donor is more effective for more regular donors and priming identity as a local community member is more effective for people in smaller communities.

How Noncompete Enforceability Affects the Creation, Growth, and Survival of New Firms","This paper examines how the enforceability of noncompete covenants affects the creation, growth, and survival of spinouts and other new entrants. The impact of noncompete enforceability on new firms is ambiguous, since noncompetes reduce knowledge leakage but impose hiring costs. However, we posit that enforceability screens formation of within-industry spinouts (WSOs) relative to non-WSOs by dissuading founders with lower human capital. Using data on 5.5 million new firms, we find greater enforceability is associated with fewer WSOs, but relative to non-WSOs, WSOs that are created tend to start and stay larger, are founded by higher-earners, and are more likely to survive their initial years. In contrast, we find no impact on non-WSO entry and a negative effect on size and short-term survival. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2614.

Because the risk of extraction increases in lead age, physicians may extract leads to reduce the future risk of mandatory extraction, due to either infection or limited space in the vein. We develop discrete-time semi-Markov decision process models for various types of cardiac devices to determine patient-specific, lifetime-maximizing extraction policies as a function of patient age and the age of every implanted lead. We use clinical data to calibrate these models and present insightful numerical results, including comparisons to policies commonly used in practice. Our numerical experiments suggest that extracting failed leads only when forced to because of space limitations is usually a good rule of thumb, but that following the optimal policy, as opposed to the commonly used heuristic policies, can extend an average patient\u2019s expected lifetime by up to 1.2 years and decrease the likelihood of device-related death by up to 94% in some cases.

We do so by analyzing the effects of the American Inventor\u2019s Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA)\u2014which required U.S. patent applications to be published 18 months after their filing date rather than at patent grant\u2014on the timing of licensing deals in the biomedical industry. We find that post-AIPA U.S. patent applications are significantly more likely to be licensed before patent grant and shortly after 18-month publication. Licensing delays are reduced by about 10 months, on average, after AIPA\u2019s enactment. These findings suggest a hitherto unexplored benefit of the patent system: by requiring inventions to be published through a credible, standardized, and centralized repository, it mitigates information costs for buyers and sellers, and thus facilitates transactions in the market for ideas.

Accounting Econom. 20(2):125\u2013153]). Another explanation involves timely loss recognition stemming from conservative accounting (e.g., Basu [Basu S (1997) The conservatism principle and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings. J. Accounting Econom. 24(1):3\u201337]). We provide direct evidence that curtailments are an important factor contributing to the lower persistence of losses.

We show that even when the firm and the consumers have the same beliefs about the product\u2019s safety, there are incentives for the firm to seek safety certification. The main analysis investigates the role of consumer moral hazard and shows that it can lead to greater incentives for voluntary certification when inherent product safety and effort are substitutes, but smaller incentives when they are complements. The analysis of consumer moral hazard provides a nuanced perspective on the so-called risk compensation or the \u201cPeltzman effect\u201d phenomenon, which postulates higher levels of accidents for safer products. In our paper, products that are successfully certified can end up with a higher incidence of accidents.

Our objective is to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with flexible sourcing when suppliers are strategic price setters. We show that when each supplier announces a single (wholesale) price, such a game leads to a conflict of incentives and is not realistic in most practical settings. Therefore, we focus on a contingent-pricing game, with wholesale prices contingent on the manufacturer\u2019s sourcing strategy. We describe the resulting equilibrium outcomes corresponding to the manufacturer\u2019s different sourcing and inventory strategies. We show that in equilibrium, inventories are carried either by the manufacturer or by the unreliable supplier, but not both. The manufacturer does not necessarily benefit from the existence of a backup supplier and, in fact, is typically worse off. Similarly, supply chain performance may degrade. Thus, an up-front commitment to sole sourcing may be beneficial. Interestingly, suppliers may benefit from flexible sourcing even though the manufacturer does not. The main results extend to cases when partial backup sourcing is allowed, both suppliers are unreliable, recovery times are non-memoryless, an unreliable supplier may provide a richer set of contingent prices, or the supplier may be risk averse.

However, their predictions are at times contradictory and there is relatively little empirical evidence with which to evaluate them. We therefore develop an integrated, multiperiod model of the optimal number of suppliers that combines search and coordination theory, transaction cost economics, and incomplete contracts theory, and we assess our theoretical predictions using a large new data set on the global IT sourcing decisions of 1,355 firms in 12 countries. Our empirical results support three key predictions about trust, IT, and supply base size. First, investments in coordination IT, which reduce search and coordination costs, are correlated with using more suppliers, while use of vendor-specific IT is associated with fewer suppliers. Second, repeated relationships and trust play a major role in supply chain governance. As firms work with fewer suppliers, they also engage in more repeated relationships. At the same time asset specificity and the need to induce relationship-specific investments are correlated not only with fewer suppliers, but also with a larger fraction of repeated relationships. Third, supply chain governance differs in human capital-intensive and physical capital-intensive industries. The correspondence between asset specificity and repetition is strong in physical capital-intensive firms and not significant in human capital-intensive firms, while the correspondence between fewer suppliers and more repeated relationships is strong in human capital-intensive firms but not significant in physical capital-intensive firms. This corroborates the differential implications of human and physical capital for bargaining power, contractual risk, and trust in buyer\u2013supplier relationships.

Exactly how does productivity spill over across this type of relationship (i.e., through which mechanisms)? Additionally, how does the relative importance of these mechanisms depend on the structure of the supply chain? To answer these questions, we decompose the channels of upstream productivity spillovers\u2014from customers to suppliers\u2014by developing a structural econometric model on a sample of approximately 22,500 supply chain dyads. We find that the \u201cendogenous channel\u201d (i.e., the effect of the customer\u2019s own productivity on the supplier\u2019s productivity) is by far the most important source of spillovers. This is especially true if (i) the supplier has a concentrated customer base, (ii) the supplier and the customer have similar operational characteristics, and (iii) the relationship has medium maturity. In the converse scenarios, we find, it is more important to have a partner with a portfolio of favorable \u201ccontextual\u201d characteristics (high inventory turnover, financial liquidity, and asset turnover) than to have a productive partner.

We argue that today\u2019s firms should view product design and investments to reduce buyer uncertainty as an integrated process, which is in turn influenced by how much information buyers can obtain from third-party infomediaries. We introduce a game-theoretic model of a competitive market where both quality production and quality disclosure are endogenous decisions, affected by information made available by third parties. We show that quality investment under uncertainty never exceeds the level of quality investment under perfect information. Furthermore, we show that information availability by third parties allows firms to free ride, and it especially favors lower quality firms, who can reduce their information disclosure investments more so than higher-quality firms. Finally, we show that the intuitive argument that firms must improve their product quality when overall information availability in the market improves does not always hold. Instead, improved information availability may enable firms to reduce their quality in some situations. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2634.

Compared to grid-based numerical schemes, the partitioning algorithm gives the closed-form solution without discretization error, and in many cases does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The algorithm is applied to two applications. In the main application, we present a model for limit order books with stochastic market depth to study the optimal order execution problem; stochastic market depth is consistent with empirical studies and necessary to accommodate various order activities. The optimal execution policy obtained by the algorithm significantly outperforms that of a deterministic market depth model in numerical examples. In the second application, we use the algorithm to compute the exact optimal solution to the renewable electricity management problem, for which previously only an approximate solution was known. As a comparison, we show that the approximate solution can be quite inaccurate for some initial states and thus demonstrate an advantage of the exact solution.

However, behavioral theory suggests that rather than updating their beliefs, individuals may persevere in their prior beliefs. In particular, we examine how individuals\u2019 prior experiences and the experiences of those around them alter their belief perseverance in operational decisions after the revelation of negative news. We draw on an exogenous announcement of negative news by the Food and Drug Administration and explore how it affects interventional cardiologists deciding between two types of cardiac stents. Analyzing 147,000 choices over six years, we find that individuals do respond to negative news by using the focal production tool less often. However, we find that both individuals\u2019 own experiences and others\u2019 experiences alter their responses. Moreover, although individual and other experience act as substitutes before negative news, we find that this substitution significantly curtails following the negative announcement. Finally, we find that experience leads doctors to discount negative news more rapidly over time.

We use the heterogeneity in buyer search cost to rationalize why a firm offers periodic price discounts and enjoys a high profit in such a market. An estimation method is proposed to recover the nonparametric distribution of buyer search cost from the price and transaction volume data. With both data, we show that the search cost distribution can be estimated nonparametrically in a sequential search model, and estimation results from a nonsequential search model are robust to the assumption on the maximum number of searches. We also show that the commonly observed high-low pricing strategy can be an optimal strategy for firms when buyers search for price information sequentially. As an empirical application, we use the proposed method to estimate the two search models using data on a commodity product sold by a firm in a business-to-business market. The models predict a high profit margin for the firm, which is consistent with the data, but the sequential search model fits with the observed price distributions and supply costs better than the nonsequential search model.

In the proposed model, the only means of spread of information about the product is via word-of-mouth communication; consumers\u2019 knowledge of the product is only through friends who already know about the product\u2019s existence. Both buyers and nonbuyers contribute to information diffusion, while buyers are more likely to spread the news about the product. By analyzing the structure of the underlying endogenous dynamic process, we show that the optimal dynamic pricing policy for durable products with zero or negligible marginal cost drops the price to zero infinitely often. The firm uses free offers to attract low-valuation agents and to get them more engaged in the spread. As a result, the firm can reach potential high-valuation consumers in parts of the network that would otherwise remain untouched without the price drops. We provide evidence for this behavior from the smartphone app market, where price histories indicate frequent zero-price sales. Moreover, we show that despite dropping the price to zero infinitely often, the optimal price trajectory does not get trapped near zero. We demonstrate the validity of our results in the face of forward-looking consumers and homophily in word-of-mouth engagement. We further unravel the key role of the product type in the optimality of zero-price sales by showing that the price fluctuations disappear after a finite time for a nondurable product.

With chief executive officers\u2019 (CEOs) prominent role in both governing bodies, their independence from CEOs\u2019 self-serving behavior might be related to each other. We explore the interdependence using an external shock increasing board independence. The shock weakens executive suite independence by increasing CEO connectedness within executive suites through appointments and preexisting social ties. We also uncover interesting dynamics between the two governing bodies: (1) the spillover does not occur when treated firms increase CEO-independent director social ties, suggesting CEO-executive connections and CEO-director connections are substitutes; (2) consistent with theories of board independence, when an information environment calls for dependent boards, increasing CEO-executive connections, which helps negate the shock effect on the board, has positive marginal effects on firm performance.

In this paper, we present three studies investigating how to reduce algorithm aversion. In incentivized forecasting tasks, participants chose between using their own forecasts or those of an algorithm that was built by experts. Participants were considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect algorithm when they could modify its forecasts, and they performed better as a result. Notably, the preference for modifiable algorithms held even when participants were severely restricted in the modifications they could make (Studies 1\u20133). In fact, our results suggest that participants\u2019 preference for modifiable algorithms was indicative of a desire for some control over the forecasting outcome, and not for a desire for greater control over the forecasting outcome, as participants\u2019 preference for modifiable algorithms was relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the modifications they were able to make (Study 2). Additionally, we found that giving participants the freedom to modify an imperfect algorithm made them feel more satisfied with the forecasting process, more likely to believe that the algorithm was superior, and more likely to choose to use an algorithm to make subsequent forecasts (Study 3). This research suggests that one can reduce algorithm aversion by giving people some control\u2014even a slight amount\u2014over an imperfect algorithm\u2019s forecast.

To address this, we adapt two machine learning methods, regularization and cross-validation, for portfolio optimization. First, we introduce performance-based regularization (PBR), where the idea is to constrain the sample variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation (SAA) and PBR solutions and the corresponding efficient frontiers. To calibrate the right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new, performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally weighted portfolio. We find that PBR dominates all other benchmarks for two out of three Fama\u2013French data sets.

Credible Forecast Guidance in a Cost-Loss Game","What is the most credible way to convey the risk in expert forecasts to the nonexpert decision makers who use the forecast? We test two ways to communicate this information: provide an unequivocal recommendation or equivocate by providing the probability of the uncertain event of interest. We use a simple game in which human subjects (the forecast users) decide whether to take a risk of a loss or pay a cost to avoid the risk. We find that the influence of forecast information differs depending on whether the information implies that the decision maker should take the status quo action, the preforecast optimal action, or the siren action, optimal only if the period-by-period forecast implies it. Unequivocal recommendations are more successful at inducing the status quo action. Equivocating by providing probabilities is more successful at inducing the siren action. Unequivocal recommendations to take the siren action are less effective because the false certainty makes them more vulnerable to the \u201ccry wolf\u201d effect. A forecast that combines probabilities with recommendations captures most of the gains of the separate approaches. A follow-up study examines whether an explanation of how risk quantities inform recommendations can substitute for providing the risk quantities in the forecast.

This distortion creates costs for individuals, the organizations in which they work, and society at large. We show that an effective way to overcome this bias is by making the implications of one\u2019s behavior salient in real time, while individuals can directly adapt. In a large-scale field experiment, we gave participants real-time feedback on the resource consumption of a daily, energy-intensive activity (showering). We find that real-time feedback reduced resource consumption for the target behavior by 22%. At the household level, this led to much larger conservation gains in absolute terms than conventional policy interventions that provide aggregate feedback on resource use. High baseline users displayed a larger conservation effect, in line with the notion that real-time feedback helps eliminate \u201cslack\u201d in resource use. The approach is cost effective, is technically applicable to the vast majority of households, and generated savings of 1.2 kWh per day and household, which exceeds the average energy use for lighting.

Collaborative consumption has emerged as a major trend as the global economic recession and social concerns about consumption sustainability lead consumers and society as a whole to explore more efficient use of resources and products. We develop an analytical framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product sharing among consumers. A consumer who purchased a firm\u2019s product can derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing market have a nonmonotonic effect on the firm\u2019s profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically chooses its retail price, consumers\u2019 sharing of products with high marginal costs is a win-win situation for the firm and the consumers, whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be a lose-lose situation. Furthermore, in the presence of the sharing market, the firm will find it optimal to strategically increase its quality, leading to higher profits but lower consumer surplus.

We formulate and estimate a dynamic game of entry in which forward-looking firms make decisions not just based on present benefits of past entry but also anticipating potential future benefits of current entry. Dynamic spillovers of entry are incorporated through a firm-specific unobservable (to the researcher) cost that depends on past entry decisions. The unobserved costs may also be serially persistent. Thus, the model allows for firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity that evolves based on firm actions. The challenge of estimating a dynamic game with serially correlated unobserved state variables subject to endogenous feedback is overcome by embedding a particle filter-based technique in a nested fixed-point algorithm. Using an application to a stylized model of entry in the generic pharmaceutical industry, we underscore the motivation for the model specification and the methodology developed. Our estimates imply positive spillover effects of entry. Moreover, these spillovers suggest heterogeneity not just across firms but also within firms over time based on their history of entry decisions. Our results illustrate that entry may potentially provide firms with additional strategic advantage in later markets and that entry spillovers may be an important factor to consider in the equilibrium evolution of the generic drug industry.

In doing this, we study the relative dynamic pricing implications of how current retail and wholesale prices for a brand must optimally take into account past and future demand, respectively, for the brand. Using scanner data from the cola market, we find that while the retailer exploits the benefit of inertial demand by appropriately increasing the retail profit margin, the cost of investing is borne entirely by the manufacturers. We use simulation studies to show how the retailer will lose its ability to leverage the benefits of inertial demand as consumers become more price sensitive. We also show that when inertia of the more price-sensitive customer segment increases, the aggregate welfare of consumers, the retailer, and manufacturers may increase.

We found substantial reluctance to bet against the success of preferred U.S. presidential candidates and Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball, and NCAA hockey teams. This reluctance was not attributable to optimism or a general aversion to hedging. Reluctance to hedge desired outcomes stemmed from identity signaling, a desire to preserve an important aspect of the bettor\u2019s identity. Reluctance to hedge occurred when the diagnostic cost of the negative self-signal that hedging would produce outweighed the pecuniary rewards associated with hedging. Participants readily accepted hedges and pure gambles with no diagnostic costs. They also more readily accepted hedges with diagnostic costs when the pecuniary rewards associated with those hedges were greater. Reluctance to hedge identity-relevant outcomes produced two anomalies in decision making, risk seeking and dominance violations. More than 45% of NCAA fans in Studies 5 and 6, for instance, turned down a \u201cfree\u201d real $5 bet against their team.

Consequently, consumers can strategically time their purchases, weighing the costs of monitoring and the risk of inventory depletion against prospectively lower prices. At the same time, firms can observe and exploit their customers\u2019 monitoring behavior. Using a data set tracking customers of a North American specialty retail brand, we present empirical evidence that monitoring products online is associated with successfully obtaining discounts. We develop a structural model of consumers\u2019 dynamic monitoring to find substantial heterogeneity, with consumers\u2019 opportunity costs for an online visit ranging from $2 to $25 in inverse relation to their price elasticities. Our estimation results have important implications for retail operations. The randomized markdown policy benefits retailers by combining price commitment with the exploitation of heterogeneity in consumers\u2019 monitoring costs. We estimate that the retailer\u2019s profit under randomized markdowns is 81% higher than from subgame-perfect, state-contingent pricing, because the retailer need not limit its inventory to credibly limit markdowns, which permits its jointly optimal inventory stock to expand by 133%. The welfare gain from these larger inventories splits nearly equally into retailer profit and consumer surplus. We also discuss targeting customers with price promotions using their online histories and the implications of reducing consumers\u2019 monitoring costs.

Sellers may induce a prospective buyer into a bad purchase through comparative deceptive advertising. The central contribution of this paper is the characterization of a class of pooling equilibria in which low-quality sellers deceive a buyer who is Bayes-rational and makes a purchase decision on the basis of the available information. The analysis of these equilibria suggests that high-quality firms should pursue more intensive advertising campaigns than their low-quality competitors. Surprisingly, we find conditions under which sellers\u2019 expected profit is higher in pooling equilibria than in the separating equilibrium in which quality is reflected by prices and there is no need to waste resources in advertising. Hence, we show that there are plausible cases in which firms should be ex ante willing to tolerate some degree of deceptive advertising by low-quality competitors. In addition, although in these equilibria the buyer purchases low-quality goods with positive probability, the expected utility can be higher than in a separating equilibrium in which the buyer purchases the high-quality good for sure. In this sense, the model also offers an argument in favor of a lenient regulatory approach to deceptive advertising. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2665.

The approach is based on optimizations, posited on the model space, that have constraints specifying the level of dependency measured by a nonparametric distance to some nominal independent and identically distributed input model. We study approximation methods for these optimizations via simulation and analysis of variance.

Yet a significant body of research suggests that firms that sacrifice long-term investment to manage earnings are often rewarded for doing so. This paper presents a model to help reconcile the tension between these apparently contradictory perspectives. We show that if the source of long-term advantage is modeled as a stock of capability that accumulates over time, the intensity of the firm\u2019s effort to manage short-term earnings at the expense of long-term investment can have very different consequences depending on whether the firm\u2019s capability is close to a critical \u201ctipping threshold.\u201d When the firm operates above this threshold, aggressively managing earnings smooths revenue and cash flow with few long-term consequences. Below it, managing earnings can tip the firm into a vicious cycle of accelerating decline.

We trace the enculturation trajectories of employees in a midsized technology firm based on analyses of 10.24 million internal emails. Our language-based model of changing cultural fit (1) predicts individual attainment; (2) reveals distinct patterns of adaptation for employees who exit voluntarily, exit involuntarily, and remain employed; (3) demonstrates that rapid early cultural adaptation reduces the risk of involuntary, but not voluntary, exit; and (4) finds that a decline in cultural fit for individuals who had successfully enculturated portends voluntary departure.

By construction, these ads differ in prominence: ads higher up the list are more prominent than ads lower down the list. However, search ads also differ in prominence in another way: prominence of advertiser. This paper examines how these two types of prominence interact in determining the click-through rate (CTR) of these ads. Using individual-level click-stream data from Microsoft\u2019s Live Search platform and measures of advertiser prominence from Alexa.com, we find that ad position and advertiser prominence are substitutes. Specifically, in searches for camera brands, a retailer not in the top 100 of Alexa rankings has a 30%\u201350% higher CTR in position 1 than in position 2, whereas a retailer in the top 100 of Alexa rankings has only a 0%\u201313% higher CTR for the same position improvement.

We first show that all affine term structure models with state space \u211d\ud835\udc40+\u00d7\u211d\ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udc40\u211d+M\u00d7\u211dN\u2212M can be drift normalized and show when the standard variance normalization can be obtained. Using this normalization, we find conditions for a wide class of affine term structure models to exhibit unspanned stochastic volatility (USV). We show that the USV conditions restrict both the mean reversions of risk factors and the cross section of conditional yield volatilities. The restrictions imply that previously studied affine USV models are unlikely to be able to generate the observed cross section of yield volatilities. However, more general USV models can match the cross section of bond volatilities.

When viewed separately, most people favor action in the former and disapprove of action in the latter, despite identical consequences. The difference is often explained in terms of the intention principle\u2014whether the consequences are intended or incidental. Our results suggest that when the two problems are considered together, a different judgment emerges: participants reject the intention principle and embrace either the principle of utilitarianism, which favors action in both problems, or the action principle, which rejects action in both problems. In subsequent studies, we find that when required to choose between two harmful actions, people prefer the action that saves more lives, despite its being more aversive. Our findings shed light on the formation of moral judgment under normative conflict, the conditions for preference reversal, and the potential polarization of moral judgment under joint evaluation.

In line with our predictions, we find clustering of patent filings around month-ends, with month-end applications being more complex than those filed on other days. Consistent with time pressure reducing work quality, we find that work quality is lower for tasks completed at month-ends, more so for process measures of quality than for outcome measures.

The results presented to date have been mixed. Using three different studies, we provide additional evidence on the relationship between testosterone and self-employment.

As testosterone levels could be affected by social, economic, and biological factors during one\u2019s life course, we draw more robust inferences by assessing whether the 2D:4D digit ratio, a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure, influences the likelihood of self-employment. From Understanding Society\u2019s Innovation Panel Wave 6, we tested separate models for 449 males and 525 females, and our results indicate that males (respectively, females) with a lower 2D:4D ratio in their left hand, or higher prenatal testosterone exposure, have a significantly greater (respectively, marginally significant) likelihood of self-employment (two-tailed test). Finally, we examine the twin testosterone transfer effect in a sample of opposite-sex and same-sex twins from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States and provide additional support for the marginally significant (two-tailed test) positive association between testosterone and self-employment.

We find that the word-of-mouth effect on the consumer side and the observational learning effect on the merchant side contribute to and reinforce the expansion of a two-sided platform. However, a larger number of deals intensifies the competition, which then lowers per deal sales and limits the number of deal offerings. We find that local characteristics have significant impact on both the deal demand and the supply side. We further use model simulation to show how differences in growth patterns across markets may be driven by local characteristics, and we decompose their relative impact on the demand and supply sides.

The NED is internally consistent and distinct from scales and measures of intelligence, cognitive ability, cognitive reflection, general decision-making ability, preference for control, and attributional style. Individual differences in correspondence bias predict blaming people for harmful accidents, believing coerced confessions, correcting for job and task difficulty when making performance evaluations and incentive-compatible personnel selections, and separating market and fund performance when making incentive-compatible investments. Fortunately, the tendency to commit correspondence bias can be reduced. Making situational information easier to process debiases those most prone to correspondence bias.

Before working on a task, participants choose what percentage of their payoffs will be based on a piece-rate compensation scheme; the rest of their payoff is allocated to a competitive compensation scheme. This novel procedure allows us to distinguish between 101 levels of competitiveness, as opposed to the binary measure used in the literature. Whereas the binary measure allows researchers to conclude that about twice as many men as women choose to compete (typically two-thirds versus one-third), the new procedure sheds light on the intensive margin. We find that the intensity of the preference is more extreme than the binary measure could detect. For example, we find that only one-fifth of the most competitive 25% of our participants are women, and the most competitive 10% of our participants are all men. The new procedure also allows us to study the correlation between competitiveness and parameters such as overconfidence, attitudes toward risk, and ambiguity.

However, effective implementation of these strategies can be challenging. Firms need to integrate the heterogeneous service level requirements of different customers into the pooling model and allocate the resources (inventory or capacity) appropriately in the most effective manner. The traditional analysis of inventory pooling, for instance, considers the performance metric in a centralized system and does not address the associated issue of inventory allocation. Using Blackwell\u2019s Approachability Theorem, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions to relate the fill rate requirement of each customer to the resources needed in the system. This provides a new approach to studying the value of resource pooling in a system with differentiated service requirements. Furthermore, we show that with \u201callocation flexibility,\u201d the amount of safety stock needed in a system with independent and identically distributed demands does not grow with the number of customers but instead diminishes to zero and eventually becomes negative as the number of customers grows sufficiently large. This surprising result holds for all demand distributions with bounded first and second moments.

Consumer switching generates inefficiency in the process of matching advertisers to consumers, because advertisers may not reach some consumers and may impress others too many times. We find that when advertisers are heterogeneous in their valuations for reaching consumers, the switching-induced inefficiency leads lower-value advertisers to advertise on a limited set of publishers, reducing the effective demand for advertising and thus depressing prices. As the share of switching consumers expands (e.g., when consumers adopt the Internet for news or increase their use of aggregators), ad prices fall. We demonstrate that increased switching creates an incentive for publishers to invest in quality as well as extend the number of unique users, because larger publishers are favored by advertisers seeking broader \u201creach\u201d (more unique users) while avoiding inefficient duplication.

In each store visit, each customer samples a full preference list of the products consistent with her partial order, forms a consideration set, and then chooses to purchase the most preferred product among the considered ones. Our approach involves: (a) defining behavioral models to build consideration sets as subsets of the products on offer, (b) proposing a clustering algorithm for determining customer segments, and (c) deriving marginal distributions for partial preferences under the multinomial logit model.

We focus on the relatively understudied domain of online-first retailers and the engagement of a key omnichannel tactic; specifically, introduction of showrooms (physical locations where customers can view and try products) in combination with online fulfillment that uses centralized inventory management. We ask whether, and if so, how, showrooms benefit the two most basic retail objectives: demand generation and operational efficiency. Using quasi-experimental data on showroom openings by WarbyParker.com, the leading and iconic online-first eyewear retailer, we find that showrooms: (1) increase demand overall and in the online channel as well; (2) generate operational spillovers to the other channels by attracting customers who, on average, have a higher cost-to-serve; (3) improve overall operational efficiency by increasing conversion in a sampling channel and by decreasing returns; and (4) amplify these demand and operational benefits in dealing with customers who have the most acute need for the firm\u2019s products. Moreover, the effects we document strengthen with time as showrooms contribute not only to brand awareness but also to what we term channel awareness as well. We conclude by elaborating the underlying customer dynamics driving our findings and by offering implications for how online-first retailers might deploy omnichannel tactics.

To address this paradox, this paper proposes that the unit of law-of-effect can be extended from a decision level to a strategy level (i.e., a group of planned decisions). A strategy organizes decisions from being consistent with the law-of-effect in one extreme to being consistent with escalation of commitment in another extreme. This paper shows that the favorability of the law-of-effect strategy (versus the escalation strategy) is likely to be underestimated at the beginning of a learning process. This underestimation stabilizes over time because negative consequences decrease the likelihood of choosing the law-of-effect strategy in the future. Accordingly, escalation strategy will be preferred more in the learning process, thereby developing a pattern of behaviors that is contradictory to the law-of-effect at the decision level but consistent with the law-of-effect at the strategy level. This learning pattern was demonstrated in three simulations with different combinations that were specified to capture different aspects of escalation of commitment. This learning perspective offers a novel explanation of escalation, suggesting that escalation may occur without distorted motivation or cognition.

This analysis reveals that citations are robustly correlated with performance, which confirms that citations are a useful quality-adjusted measure for innovation. The citing practices of patent attorneys and examiners, however, also influence citations. Patent attorneys cite early patents, which help establish the patentability of an invention; this practice may inflate citation counts for early patents, particularly for inventions that have only recently become patentable. Attorneys also add self-citations; our analysis indicates that self-citations are an indicator of follow-on invention.

We explore several properties of node collapses: their efficacy in helping firms achieve superior network positions, the externalities they impose on other network actors, and how they provide exclusive control over both internal and network resources. Using a simulation in which actors compete to acquire one another, we model network dynamics driven by node collapses.

Staffing Decisions in Nursing Homes","Over the past 10 years, many healthcare organizations have made significant investments in automating their clinical operations, mostly through the introduction of advanced information systems. Yet the impact of these investments on staffing is still not well understood. In this paper, we study the effect of information technology (IT)-enabled automation on staffing decisions in healthcare facilities. Using unique nursing home IT data from 2006 to 2012, we find that the licensed nurse staffing level decreases by 5.8% in high-end nursing homes but increases by 7.6% in low-end homes after the adoption of automation technology. Our research explains this by analyzing the interplay of two competing effects of automation: the substitution of technology for labor and the leveraging of complementarity between technology and labor. We also find that increased automation improves the ratings on clinical quality by 6.9% and decreases admissions of less profitable residents by 14.7% on average. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an analytical staffing model that incorporates technology adoption and vertical differentiation. Overall, these findings suggest that the impact of automation technology on staffing decisions depends crucially on a facility\u2019s vertical position in the local marketplace.

We develop a decentralized multiarmed bandit framework where a forward-looking principal (the platform designer) commits up front to a policy that dynamically discloses information regarding the history of outcomes to a series of short-lived rational agents (the consumers). We demonstrate that consumer surplus is nonmonotone in the accuracy of the designer\u2019s information-provision policy. Because consumers are constantly in \u201cexploitation\u201d mode, policies that disclose accurate information on past outcomes suffer from inadequate \u201cexploration.\u201d We illustrate how the designer can (partially) alleviate this inefficiency by employing a policy that strategically obfuscates the information in the platform\u2019s possession; interestingly, such a policy is beneficial despite the fact that consumers are aware of both the designer\u2019s objective and the precise way by which information is being disclosed to them. More generally, we show that the optimal information-provision policy can be obtained as the solution of a large-scale linear program. Noting that such a solution is typically intractable, we use our structural findings to design an intuitive heuristic that underscores the value of information obfuscation in decentralized learning. We further highlight that obfuscation remains beneficial even if the designer can directly incentivize consumers to explore through monetary payments.

International Evidence on Interest Rates and the Choice of Adjustable-Rate Mortgages","The relative popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) varies considerably both across countries and over time. We ask how movements in current and expected future interest rates affect the share of ARMs in total mortgage issuance. Using a nine-country panel and instrumental variables methods, we present evidence that near-term (one-year) rational forecasts of future movements in ARM rates do affect mortgage choice, particularly in more recent data since 2001. However, longer-term (three-year) rational forecasts of ARM rates have a relatively weak effect, and the current spread between FRM and ARM rates also matters, suggesting that households are concerned with current interest costs as well as with lifetime cost minimization.

We develop and test a dynamic model of firm capital allocation under foreign political instability. The model shows that as a political regime becomes less stable, independent of whether the regime becomes less business-friendly or more business-friendly, firms invest suboptimally (i.e., they either overinvest or underinvest), and their marginal q\u2019s diverge further from an optimal level. Using elections and textual analysis of local media during national elections, we construct a novel index of political instability. We find that U.S. firms and industries with a greater exposure to election-induced political instability experience disruptions of investment efficiency that lead to lower valuations and lower total factor productivity.

To explore these implications, we develop a continuous time investment and consumption model with capital gains tax, Epstein\u2013Zin recursive utility, and regime switching. We find that various factors, such as tax rate, risk aversion, interest rate, stock return, and volatility, jointly affect optimal portfolio allocation, whereas intertemporal substitution does not. In a regime switching market, investors may trade or stop trading purely because of a change in regime, and there is a distinct cross-regime effect on optimal portfolio allocation. In particular, investors tend to raise stock investment in a bear regime so as to reduce potential tax payments upon regime switching. Given reasonable parameter values, regime switching has a greater impact on optimal portfolio allocation in a bear regime than in a bull regime.

An Experimental Investigation","Gaudeul and Sugden [Gaudeul A, Sugden R (2012) Spurious complexity and common standards in markets for consumer goods. Economica 79(314):209\u2013225] have hypothesized that when some but not all competing products are priced in a common standard, consumers who are liable to make errors in cross-standard price comparisons use decision rules that discriminate in favor of common-standard offers. Such behavior incentivizes sellers to use common standards. We report an experimental test of this hypothesis, using choice tasks similar to those represented in the Gaudeul\u2013Sugden model. We find that offers priced in common standards were more likely to be inspected but less likely to be chosen, and that subjects gained little benefit from common pricing standards that applied to some but not all offers. Most subjects used \u201cdominance editing\u201d operations that eliminated transparently dominated offers, either as an initial shortlisting device or while offers were being sorted.

To do so, we derive the optimal product line or versions of an information good and the corresponding prices. By relaxing common assumptions on consumers\u2019 usage costs, versioning costs and capital research and development costs, we provide new insights as well as reconcile extant findings on versioning. For a good with no-free-disposal (NFD), i.e., one where consumers have usage costs, our results show that a monopolist\u2019s marginal cost and consumers\u2019 usage costs have the same impact on its versioning strategy, and that these factors are the sole reason for optimality of versioning of information goods. By endogenizing the production of the highest-quality, we show that capital costs create a downward distortion of quality even for the highest types in the market even under full information. Presence of separate versioning costs also lowers the qualities served to the high types and reduces the segment of consumers who are served with product versions. However, versioning costs do not affect market coverage or the price-quality menu itself. Further, when some of the consumer usage costs are absorbed by the firm (as in case of cloud-based provisioning), it does not necessarily lead to market expansion.

We propose a method to separate ambiguity attitudes from subjective probabilities and to decompose ambiguity attitudes into two components. Under models like prospect theory that represent ambiguity through nonadditive decision weights, these components reflect pessimism and likelihood insensitivity. Under multiple priors models, they reflect ambiguity aversion and perceived ambiguity. We apply our method in an experiment where we elicit the ask prices of options with payoffs depending on the returns of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the New York Stock Exchange. IPOs are a natural context to study the effect of learning, as prior information about their returns is unavailable. Subjects perceived substantial ambiguity and they were insensitive to likelihood information. We observed only little pessimism and ambiguity aversion.

The supplier may adopt the supplier-only role, be the solo seller in the market, or use the dual-channel strategy and compete with its downstream buyer. In comparison to the case of unlimited capacity, we show that the supplier, the buyer, and consumers may all benefit from the supplier\u2019s limited capacity at the same time, leading to a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d outcome. We also find that, under limited capacity, the downstream buyer may order the supplier\u2019s entire capacity and strategically withhold some supply from being sold to the market even if there is no underlying supply-side or demand-side uncertainty. Our result points to a new form of strategic purchasing behavior by the buyer in the face of upstream and downstream competition. Interestingly, we show that while buyer withholding is always beneficial for the supplier, it can reduce the buyer\u2019s profit under certain cases, although total supply chain profit is the first-best outcome. Also, counter to conventional antitrust concerns, buyer withholding at times may benefit consumers in spite of reduced downstream competition. Finally, in contrast to intuition, we find that the supplier\u2019s benefit from investing in direct selling capability is highest when its capacity size is moderate and not large.

For example, car fuel economy can be expressed as fuel efficiency (\u201cmiles per gallon\u201d), fuel cost in dollars, or tons of greenhouse gases emitted. Each expression, or \u201ctranslation,\u201d highlights a different aspect of the same attribute. We describe a new mechanism whereby translated attributes can serve as decision \u201csignposts\u201d because they (1) activate otherwise dormant objectives, such as proenvironmental values and goals, and (2) direct the person toward the option that best achieves the activated objective. Across three experiments, we provide evidence for the occurrence of such signpost effects as well as the underlying psychological mechanism. We demonstrate that expressing an attribute such as fuel economy in terms of multiple translations can increase preference for the option that is better aligned with objectives congruent with this attribute (e.g., the more fuel-efficient car for those with proenvironmental attitudes), even when the new information is derivable from other known attributes. We discuss how using translated attributes appropriately can help align a person\u2019s choices with their personal objectives.

We conduct four discrete choice experiments on two distinct populations and identify several \u201coperational\u201d attributes (e.g., delay to care and choice of doctor) that affect patient choice. We observe an interesting gender effect with respect to how patients trade off speed (delay to care) and quality (doctor of choice), and demonstrate that risk attitudes mediate the impact of gender on the perception of speed and quality. Specifically, females (versus males) are more averse to not seeing their own doctor, and, when delay to care is relatively long, females perceive greater utility loss than males. As many operational strategies in outpatient care aim to improve the patient experience by making trade-offs between speed and quality, we make suggestions for when managers should intervene to improve their practice and how such interventions might look based on the patient mix and current delay level.

I argue that, conditional on changes in opportunity, people (especially those with Machiavellian personalities) choose to retain ties to valuable contacts, they retain reciprocated ties (especially with highly empathic others), and they retain socially embedded ties (especially if they are low self-monitors).

We examine these questions using the audit industry as a setting because of the availability of client, city, and office characteristic data at each audit office. This setting also allows us to answer whether immigration can address the growing human capital constraint in the audit industry.

When time-to-market constraints are binding, important questions are how to divide limited time between the two stages and who should make this decision. We introduce a laboratory experiment that closely resembles this setting: it features a product development task with an open design space, a downstream cost increase, and two development stages. We show that performance is significantly worse when designers choose for themselves when to transition from ideation to execution and that decision control explains a large share of performance variation even after controlling for individual differences. How the time is allocated between ideation and execution does not affect mean performance, but later transition increases risk. One driver of poor design outcomes in the designer-initiated transition regime are delays in physical construction and testing of designs. We show that such delays can be prevented by \u201cnudging\u201d designers toward early prototyping. However, the most important performance driver is the lack of task structure in endogenous regimes, which can be remedied by demanding a concrete, performance-oriented deliverable prior to a transition.

The firm may offer a selection of service classes that are differentiated in prices and delays. Using a deterministic relaxation, which simplifies the problem by preserving the economic aspects of price-and-delay differentiation while ignoring queueing delays, we construct a solution to the fully stochastic problem that is incentive compatible and near optimal in systems with large capacity and market potential. Our approach provides several new insights for large-scale systems: (i) the deterministic analysis captures all pricing, differentiation, and delay characteristics of the stochastic solution that are nonnegligible at large scale; (ii) service differentiation is optimal when the less delay-sensitive market segment is sufficiently elastic; (iii) the use of \u201cstrategic delay\u201d depends on system capacity and market heterogeneity\u2014and it contributes significant delay when the system capacity is underutilized or when the firm offers three or more service classes; and (iv) connecting economic optimization to queueing theory, the revenue-optimized system has the premium class operating in a \u201cquality-driven\u201d regime and the lower-tier service classes operating with noticeable delays that arise either endogenously (\u201cefficiency-driven\u201d regime) or with the addition of strategic delay by the service provider.

Here, we explore an alternative approach, social norms. We inform individuals about the volume of reviews authored by peers. We test the effectiveness of using financial incentives, social norms, and a combination of both strategies in motivating consumers. In two randomized experiments, one in the field conducted in partnership with a large online clothing retailer based in China and a second on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we compare the effectiveness of each strategy in stimulating online reviews in larger numbers and of greater length. We find that financial incentives are more effective at inducing larger volumes of reviews, but the reviews that result are not particularly lengthy, whereas social norms have a greater effect on the length of reviews. Importantly, we show that the combination of financial incentives and social norms yields the greatest overall benefit by motivating reviews in greater numbers and of greater length.

In our setting, a retailer offers a supplier contract terms for a product, where the product can be low or high quality. The supplier can choose to exert high effort, which is costly but guarantees high quality, or low effort, which does not assure high quality with certainty. We compare how monetary incentives, such as a bonus that is paid to the supplier when high quality is received by the retailer, and relational incentives, such as the two parties engaging in a long-term relationship where there is the threat of punishment, affect overall quality and supply chain efficiency. Two of our primary results suggest that (1) relational incentives improve both quality and supply chain efficiency, regardless of whether a monetary incentive is present, and (2) when relational incentives are present, the impact of adding monetary incentives is nonmonotonic: less efficient monetary incentives appear to crowd out the benefits of relational incentives leading even to a reduction in supply chain efficiency, whereas more efficient monetary incentives actually complement relational incentives and lead to significant increases in both quality and supply chain efficiency.

If past purchase behavior on a product category is positively correlated with a consumer having high preferences in another category, a firm may want to advertise more intensively to those consumers that purchased the former category, if possible. This paper finds that this can lead to lower prices in the initial category if the annoyance of receiving advertising is large, and to higher prices if the annoyance of receiving advertising is not too large, as consumers expect a possible additional surplus from the category affected by behavior-based advertising. If receiving advertising does not yield too much annoyance to consumers, firms end up better off due to both higher prices and the increased demand of better matching of advertising. Behavior-based advertising may also lead firms to sell less in the initial category than without behavior-based advertising, as a way to be able to better target the most valuable consumers. If the consumer annoyance of receiving advertising is large, firms may end up serving only a few consumers initially, as attracting more consumers requires prices that are too low, and the initial consumers are attracted because of the possibility of lower prices in the following period. The paper also investigates the effects of joint behavior-based pricing and advertising, and of different firms benefiting from the purchase information.

The capacity of such networks is generally smaller than the bottleneck capacity. In Gurvich and Van Mieghem [Gurvich I, Van Mieghem JA (GVM1) Collaboration and multitasking in networks: Architectures, bottlenecks, and capacity. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 17(1):16\u201333], we proved that both capacities are equal in networks with a hierarchical collaboration architecture, which define a collaboration level for each task depending on how many types of resources it requires. This paper studies how task prioritization impacts the achievable capacity of such hierarchical networks using a conceptual queueing framework that formalizes coordination and switching idleness. To maximize the capacity of a collaborative network, highest priority must be given to the tasks that require the most collaboration. Otherwise, a mismatch between priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity loss. We demonstrate this fundamental tension between flexibility in task prioritization (ability to adjust quality of service) and capacity (productivity) in a basic collaborative network and in parallel networks. To manage this trade-off, we present a hierarchical threshold priority policy that balances switching and coordination idleness.

While the optimal mechanism cannot be reduced to posted prices (and requires personalized prices), we also present a simple, \u201clearn and then sell\u201d mechanism that is able to extract a large fraction of the maximal revenue.

Assuming that the consumer\u2019s future utility for each product alternative can be characterized by a standard random utility model, we use dynamic programming to determine the optimal consumption policy and the maximum expected value of consuming any n substitutable products selected while shopping (an n-pack). We propose two models.

Given a consumer\u2019s preferences for the product alternatives in an assortment, we then show how to identify that consumer\u2019s optimal n-pack using a simple swapping algorithm that converges in at most n swaps. In the second (generalized) model, we introduce an outside option so that a product alternative need not be consumed on each consumption occasion. We obtain a closed-form value function for the generalized model and show that its optimal n-pack is related to that of the canonical model using a special type of majorization.

Finally, we find that institutional sales accelerate the timing of a campaign at firms already followed by activists rather than attract attention to unlikely targets.

There is substantial heterogeneity in DM pay for performance. DM pay for division performance is lower in industries with less informative accounting earnings. DM pay is more sensitive to other-division performance if the DM\u2019s division is related to the rest of the firm, if the DM\u2019s division has fewer growth opportunities, and if the DM\u2019s division receives less capital from the rest of the firm. Consistent with optimal contracting view, DMs receive greater pay for other-division performance in better-governed firms. Overall, our evidence suggests that DM compensation is structured to account for the information and agency problems in multidivision firms.

New Evidence from Individual-Level Horse Race Bets","Many empirical studies focusing on how prior outcomes affect subsequent risk taking report conclusions that appear mutually contradictory. While some studies document increased risk taking after gains and risk aversion after losses, others report the opposite. This paper contributes to this literature by investigating horse race bettors\u2019 sequential risky decisions using individual-level data. A horse race betting market is a laboratory-like environment and can be used to analyze behavioral patterns associated with decision making under risk. We find evidence for (i) the \u201chouse money effect\u201d as bettors take riskier wagers after gains and mostly spend the money they have won; (ii) risk aversion after prior losses, which we label a \u201cplaying safe effect\u201d; and (iii) a preference for breakeven. Contrary to the widely held conception in the empirical literature, our findings suggest that the \u201cbreak-even effect\u201d does not necessarily imply an increased preference for riskier bets because bettors may seek to break even with less risky wagers.

In particular, people tend to demand a premium on the probability of a favorable outcome in order to expose themselves to a social source of risk rather than a natural source of risk. Several explanations for what drives this social risk premium have been offered\u2014most prominently, (i)an aversion to a counterparty\u2019s potentially malign intentions and (ii) a more general aversion to ceding control to someone with conflicting interests. We propose that a fundamental determinant of the social risk premium may relate to a counterparty\u2019s capacity to engage in intentional action. We employ a between-subjects experimental design in which we manipulate subjects\u2019 capacity for intentional action. Our design allows us to identify the component of the social risk premium related to an aversion to betrayal, independent of any aversion to ceding control. Furthermore, our results show that intentions are a crucial determinant of the social risk premium. We identify factors that eliminate, and may even change the sign of, the social risk premium. Our results contribute to our understanding of the factors that influence the perception of social risk and have implications for optimal contract design in a wide variety of situations involving social risk.

Consequently, the selection of products offered offline affects the demand in both channels. We address how firms should select an optimal offline assortment to maximize profits across both channels; we call this the showcase decision problem. We incorporate the impact of physical evaluation on preferences into the consumer demand model. Under this model, we show that the decision problem is NP-hard. Analytically, we derive optimal results for special cases and near-optimal approximations for general cases. Empirically, we use conjoint analysis to identify changes in consumer preferences resulting from physically evaluating products. For this application, we demonstrate gains in expected revenue of up to 40% due to accounting for the impact of offline assortment on the online sales.

Based on detailed field data from one of Europe\u2019s largest online marketplaces for automotive vehicles, we document systematic and sizable price discontinuities at salient car-age and mileage thresholds. The price difference between two otherwise identical cars across registration years (where one was first registered in January and the other in December of the previous year) is up to five times larger than that between two cars first registered in any two subsequent months within a registration year. A similar pattern can be observed in the mileage dimension at 10,000-km odometer marks, which is in line with earlier findings in the literature. Being able to study discontinuities along two dimensions of the same good allows us to further our understanding toward a more general notion of inattentive behavior.

We also develop a generalizable method to correct for the left censoring of device-version-specific experience variables that is a common problem in highly granular experience data, using maximum simulated likelihood estimation with simulation over unobservables conditional on observables. Even for experienced surgeons, the first use of certain device versions can result in at least a 32.4% increase in surgery duration, hurting quality and productivity. Furthermore, with the passage of time, surgeons can forget knowledge gained about the use of particular devices. For certain devices, when the time gap between repeat uses increases from its median to its 75th percentile, surgery duration increases by about 3.4%. The high productivity and quality costs associated with device variety suggest that the gain from a new device design needs to be large enough to compensate for the short-term disadvantages of starting up on a new learning curve and of increasing the chances of knowledge depreciation over time.

Our analytical model provides a framework for studying how characteristics of the demand in an offline retail sales channel impact the seller\u2019s optimal reserve price in the auction channel, the probability that an auction ends in a sale, the probability that an item is sold through the auction channel, and the auction expected sale price.

Thus, assessing the intensity of competition on either side is essential to understanding firm performance. Yet, the literature provides no formal notion of \u201ccompetitive intensity\u201d with which to make such assessments. Rather, some authors use added value as their central analytic concept, others the core. Added value is simple but misses the crucial, for-an-agent side of competition. The core is theoretically complete but difficult to interpret and empirically intractable. This paper formalizes three, increasingly general notions of competitive intensity, all of which improve on added value while avoiding the complexity of the core. We analyze markets characterized by disjoint networks of agents (e.g., supply chains), providing several insights into competition and new tools for empirical work.

Management Sci. 54(9):1529\u20131543] argues that as more solvers enter the contest, every solver will reduce effort due to a lower probability of winning the contest. This paper corrects mistakes in this theory, and shows that there exist high-expertise solvers who may raise their effort in response to increased competition. This is because more entrants raise the expected best performance among other solvers, creating positive incentives for solvers to exert higher effort to win the contest. Because of this positive effect, we find that a free-entry open contest is more likely to be optimal to a contest organizer than what Terwiesch and Xu (2008) and other prior literature asserted.

We model a capacity-constrained firm, a random-sized population of strategic customers, a desirable hot period, and a less desirable slow period. Compared to a more traditional approach (slow period discounting or closure), threshold discounting has two operational advantages. First, the contingent discount temporally balances demand when the market for the service is large, and reduces supply of the service (preserving higher margins) when the market is small, allowing the firm to respond to the service\u2019s unobserved market potential. Second, activation of the threshold discount signals the market state and the consequent service availability to strategic customers, inducing them into self-selecting the consumption period to one that improves the firm\u2019s capacity utilization. Yet, threshold discounting can be harmful in situations with chronically low demand. In contrast with past work on strategic customers, their presence is advantageous to firms in our context. A calibrated numerical study shows that threshold discounting improves firm profits over a traditional approach by as much as 33% (7% on average).

Evidence from Cardiac Surgeons in Florida","Despite heated debate about the pros and cons of online physician ratings, little systematic work has examined the correlation between physicians\u2019 online ratings and their actual medical quality. Using the ratings of cardiac surgeons at RateMDs and the patient outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries in the 2013 Florida Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data, we investigate whether online ratings are informative about physicians\u2019 medical quality. To account for potentially nonrandom matchings of patients of different severity levels to surgeons of different rating categories, we focus on patients who arrived through the emergency department and explicitly consider how observed and unobserved patient health conditions jointly affect the matching arrangements and surgical outcomes. Both reduced form and two-stage estimation results show that, compared with surgeons rated four stars or higher, or those without rating information, lower rated surgeons are associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates. Our findings suggest that online physician ratings could be a valuable information source for patients to learn about physician quality, at least for cardiac surgeons, a specialty for which treatment outcomes are relatively observable to patients and their family members.

In the private effort environment, we further distinguish between situations where the contract may be based on the outcome or on the effort reported by the provider. We show that under the two-part tariff, when effort is private, the provider can achieve the same profit as under public effort by contracting on reported effort and will be worse off by contracting on outcome. Under the hourly-rate contract, compared with the public effort case, the provider may be better or worse off in keeping effort private and contracting on the reported effort, and the trade-off is affected by the degree of outcome uncertainty in a nontrivial way. We find that a provider\u2019s profits under an hourly-rate contract are as good as under a two-part tariff over a sizable parameter regime when contracting on reported effort.

We examine whether public RPF could be leveraged to facilitate adoption of best practices in an organization by enabling the validation of best practices shared by identifiable top performers. We use data from two emergency departments, both of which shared best practices for improving productivity and one of which changed from privately to publicly disclosing RPF to physicians. The public disclosure of RPF allowed workers to identify their top-performing coworkers, which in turn enabled the identification and validation of best practices within the work group. We find that the intervention is associated with a 10.9% improvement in physician productivity. We also find evidence for a significant reduction in variation in productivity across providers, which stems from bottom-ranked workers exhibiting differentially large improvements in productivity. These effects hold without sacrificing system-level performance, service quality, or worker attrition. Our results suggest that public disclosure of RPF, along with the validation of the best practices being shared, can improve worker productivity.

We consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and the service time follows an exponential distribution. There are two streams of customers, one informed about real-time delay and the other uninformed. The customers\u2019 uninformed behavior may be due to information ignorance or rational behavior in the presence of an information fee. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of customers with information heterogeneity and investigate how the presence of a larger fraction of informed customers affects the system performance measures, i.e., throughput and social welfare. We show that the effects of growing information prevalence on system performance measures are determined by the equilibrium joining behavior of uninformed customers. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that throughput and social welfare can be unimodal in the fraction of informed customers. In other words, some amount of information heterogeneity in the population can lead to more efficient outcomes, in terms of the system throughput or social welfare, than information homogeneity. For example, under a very mild condition, throughput in a system with an offered load of 1 will always suffer if there are more than 58% of informed customers in the population. Moreover, it is shown that for an overloaded system with offered load sufficiently higher than 1, social welfare always reaches its maximum when some fraction of customers is uninformed of the congestion level in real time.

To this end, they commonly employ two different and somewhat contradictory intervention approaches. One approach uses punitive tactics to coerce firms to change, while the other approach uses supportive tactics to encourage change. Using the context of government agencies promoting environmental improvements in firms, we examine whether such punitive (e.g., regulatory inspections with possible sanctions) and supportive (e.g., environmental assistance, improvement recommendations) tactics can be administered in a complementary manner. Using a unique and novel longitudinal data set collected from two state-level environmental agencies in Minnesota, we analyze over 1,000 supportive environmental improvement (EI) projects in combination with intermittent (but currently uncoordinated) punitive tactics. One key finding from our research is that the timing, severity, and relatedness of punitive tactics is critical for directing managerial attention and thus improving the efficacy of supportive tactics (i.e., EI implementation). Contingent on their timing, inspections can increase EI implementation rates by up to 60% but can also reduce implementation rates by up to 50% compared with EIs in facilities that do not experience inspections. Classifying regulatory inspections as (1) either clean or adverse and (2) either related or unrelated allows us to further explain the influence of such punitive tactics on EI implementation. Finally, we provide evidence for a positive effect of successful EI implementation on long-term environmental compliance. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2748.

However, evidence on the relationship between EHR adoption and costs is mixed, leading to skepticism about the effectiveness of EHR in decreasing costs. We argue that simply looking at the hospital-level effects can be misleading because the benefits of EHR can go beyond the adopting hospital by creating regional spillovers via information and patient sharing. When patients move between hospitals, timely and high-quality records received at one hospital can affect the costs of care at another hospital. We provide evidence that although EHR adoption increases the costs of the adopting hospital, it has significant spillover effects by reducing the costs of neighboring hospitals. We further show that these spillovers are linked to information and patient sharing. Specifically, the spillovers are stronger when more hospitals in the region are in health information exchange networks and in the same integrated delivery systems, which can share information more easily. Furthermore, utilizing regional characteristics that can affect the extent of patient sharing such as urban versus rural areas, population density, average distance between hospitals, and hospital density, we find that locations with higher patient and hospital concentration experience stronger regional spillovers. Additionally, spillovers are stronger after the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act that increased EHR adoption and use. Overall, our findings suggest that we need to take into account externalities to understand the benefits of health IT investments and form policy decisions.

The evolution over time of the number of subscribers is governed by a differential equation combining two processes\u2014namely, a customer acquisition process and a customer attrition process. Assuming profit-maximization behavior of the firm, we use dynamic programming to optimize the customer equity and determine optimal customer relationship marketing expenditures. We implement an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations to estimate the model\u2019s parameters using market data of two well-known companies in the telecommunications sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to model acquisition and retention efforts in the context of a diffusion model. By doing so, we extend the literature on product diffusion to services\u2014that is, beyond its traditional area of durable (and occasionally nondurable) products. By the same token, we contribute to the literature on customer relationship marketing (CRM), where social interactions have been overlooked. Our analytical and numerical results provide a better understanding of the relationships among the optimal customer equity, the customer lifetime value, the prospect lifetime value, and the optimal acquisition and retention spending. Our model and estimation approach give the tools for assessing empirically the role of CRM spending, social interactions, and other factors in the service subscription dynamics. Our main empirical results are as follows: (i) CRM spending and external incentives have indeed a significant effect on acquisition and retention processes; (ii) the impact of CRM is market specific; (iii) compared with optimal levels, both firms underinvest in retention; and (iv) whereas we observe increasing spending in acquisition over time, the derived optimal policy recommends a decreasing level of spending over time.

(ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer\u2019s own and competitors\u2019 stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors\u2019 prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers.

First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption influenced engagement, albeit in different ways. Firm-to-customer communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had varying effects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms offering digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact with each other postadoption.

Using transaction data, I find that hedge funds following short-term contrarian strategies (i.e., liquidity suppliers) earn significantly higher returns on their equity trades and holdings. Similarly, using commercial databases, I find that hedge funds with greater exposure to a liquidity provision factor earn significantly higher excess returns and Sharpe ratios. The superior performance of liquidity-supplying hedge funds arises from strategies that are more complex than mechanical short-term reversal strategies. For example, among stocks with similar past returns, liquidity-supplying funds are more likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by constrained mutual funds and less likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by unconstrained mutual funds. The outperformance of liquidity-supplying funds is also concentrated in periods of low funding liquidity, suggesting that less-binding financial constraints contribute to their superior returns.

When initial wealth is the reference point, however, there is often no disposition effect. Models that use a reference point with no lag under the principle of preferred personal equilibrium or that determine the reference point using the principle of disappointment aversion cannot explain why the investor bought a stock in the first place.

The objective of the fare promotion was to alleviate peak-time congestion by encouraging commuters to travel prepeak. This promotion resembles an actual public program implemented in Singapore in 2013. Using participants\u2019 fare cards, we obtained a rich data set for 60 weeks\u2019 worth of trips. A difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the effect of the free-trip offer was modest but robust during the promotional period: on average, trips were 5.5% more likely to end before the morning peak time. More encouragingly, the modest shift toward early travel strongly persisted even seven months after the end of the free-trip offer. This seemingly small shift could imply large financial savings on infrastructure investment. We find suggestive evidence that travel regularity and consistency during the promotion appear to be important for forging persistence.

The exponential growth of this nascent online phenomenon holds important social and economic implications, as the hiring decisions made on these online platforms implicate the incomes of millions of workers worldwide. Despite this importance, limited effort has been devoted to understanding whether potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may affect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and a quasi-experimental technique, we find evidence of a positive hiring bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the underlying gender-specific traits that could influence hiring outcomes. We find that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from developing countries, and not those from developed countries. Subanalyses show that women are preferred in feminine-typed occupations while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed occupations. We also find that female employers are more susceptible to the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our findings provide key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers, platform owners, hiring managers, and workers. Managerial and practical implications are discussed.

We address this issue using a distributionally robust approach to model the performance of a stochastic system under different process structures. We use the dual prices obtained from a related conic program to guide managers in the design process. This leads to a general solution methodology for the construction of efficient sparse structures for several classes of operational problems. Our approach can be used to design simple yet efficient structures for workforce deployment and for any level of sparsity requirement, to respond to deviations and disruptions in the operational environment. Furthermore, in the case of the classical process flexibility problem, our methodology can recover the k-chain structures that are known to be extremely efficient for this type of problem when the system is balanced and symmetric.

One reason for their popularity is the ability for customer service agents to multitask (i.e., interact with multiple customers at a time) thereby increasing the system \u201cthroughput\u201d and agent productivity. Yet little is known about how multitasking impacts customer satisfaction\u2014the ultimate goal of customer engagements. We address this question using a proprietary data set from an S&P 500 service firm that documents agent multitasking activities (unobservable to customers) in the form of server logs, customer service chat transcripts, and postservice customer surveys. We find that agent multitasking leads to longer in-service delays for customers and lower problem resolution rates. Both lead to lower customer satisfaction, although the impact varies for different customers. Our study is among the first to document the link between multitasking and customer satisfaction, and it has implications for the design of agent time allocation in contact centers and more broadly for how firms can best manage customer relations in new service channels enabled by information technology.

This free-riding behavior by customers is referred to as \u201cshowrooming,\u201d and we show that this is detrimental to the profits of the brick-and-mortar stores. We first analyze price matching as a short-term strategy to counter showrooming. Price matching allows customers to purchase a product from the store for less than the store\u2019s posted price, so one would expect the price matching strategy to be less effective as the fraction of customers who seek the matching increases. However, our results show that with an increase in the fraction of customers who seek price matching, the store\u2019s profits initially decrease and then increase. While price matching could be used even when customers do not exhibit showrooming behavior, we find that it is more effective when customers do showrooming. We then study exclusivity of product assortments as a long-term strategy to counter showrooming. This strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (1) by arranging for exclusivity of known brands (e.g., Macy\u2019s has such an arrangement with Tommy Hilfiger) or (2) through the creation of store brands at the brick-and-mortar store (T. J. Maxx sells a large number of store brands). Our analysis suggests that implementing exclusivity through store brands is better than exclusivity through known brands when the product category has few digital attributes. However, when customers do not showroom, the known-brand strategy dominates the store-brand strategy. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2764.

The substitute model proposes that corporate insiders pay dividends to signal and build trust with outside shareholders who lack legal protection. The outcome model, in contrast, surmises that when shareholders have legal protection, they demand dividends from insiders to prevent them from expropriating corporate funds. Either way, dividends represent an agency cost paid to align the interests of shareholders and insiders. Expropriations by insiders and reduced investment by shareholders are also agency costs, but they are difficult to identify with archival data. Using a laboratory experiment, we identify the impact of strengthened shareholder protection on all three types of agency costs. Dividend payout ratios are five times larger with stronger investor protection, insider expropriation ratios are twice as high, and outsider investment falls by 45%.

But in most realistic settings, only partial distribution information is available or reliably estimated. The distributionally robust newsvendor model is often used in this case where the worst-case expected profit is maximized over the set of distributions satisfying the known information, which is usually the mean and covariance of demands. However, covariance does not capture information on asymmetry of the demand distribution. In this paper, we introduce a measure of distribution asymmetry using second-order partitioned statistics. Semivariance is a special case with a single partition of the univariate demand. With mean, variance, and semivariance information, we show that a three-point distribution achieves the worst-case expected profit and derive a closed-form expression for the distributionally robust order quantity. For multivariate demand, the distributionally robust problem with partitioned statistics is hard to solve, but we develop a computationally tractable lower bound through the solution of a semidefinite program. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that asymmetry information significantly reduces expected profit loss particularly when the true distribution is heavy tailed. In computational experiments on automotive spare parts demand data, we provide evidence that the distributionally robust model that includes partitioned statistics outperforms the model that uses only covariance information.

Founder Race and Performance in Crowdfunding","The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of 7,617 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify whether African American men are discriminated against and whether this reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of prospective supporters. We find that African American men are significantly less likely than similar white founders to receive funding and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in quality when they believe the founder is an African American male. We conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower quality. In two additional experiments, we identify three means of reducing this bias: through additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support), through evidence that African American founders have succeeded previously, and by removing indicators of the founder\u2019s race.

However, inference may be biased by the possibility that firms who share peers also share unobserved characteristics that are correlated with observed policy. Using a novel identification strategy, we predict and find that director connections through well-known island tax havens have a significant effect on corporate tax policy. Specifically, we find that U.S. firms with directors who are connected to firms domiciled on the islands of the Bahamas, Bermuda, or the Caymans exhibit significantly greater tax avoidance than other U.S. firms. The presence or arrival of an island director is associated with a reduction of between one and three percentage points in the firm\u2019s effective tax rate. We also observe a significant increase in the use of tax haven subsidiaries following the arrival of the island director.

We provide a systematic empirical investigation of this richness by varying the uncertain events, the outcomes, and combinations of both. Although ambiguity aversion is prevailing, we also find systematic ambiguity seeking, confirming insensitivity. We find that ambiguity attitudes depend on the kind of uncertainty (the source) but not on the kind of outcomes. Ambiguity attitudes are closer to rationality (ambiguity neutrality) for natural uncertainties than for artificial Ellsberg urn uncertainties. This also appears from the reductions of monotonicity violations and of insensitivity. Ambiguity attitudes have predictive power across different outcomes and sources of uncertainty, with individual-specific components. Our rich domain serves well to test families of weighting functions for fitting ambiguity attitudes. We find that two-parameter families, capturing not only aversion but also insensitivity, are desirable for ambiguity even more than for risk.

A Network Perspective on Information Technology Labor Movements","This study examines how characteristics of an interfirm labor-flow network affect firm productivity. Using employee job histories to trace labor movement between organizations, we construct labor-flow networks for both information technology (IT) and non-IT labor and analyze how a firm\u2019s network structure for the two types of labor affects its performance. We find that hiring IT workers from a structurally diverse network of firms can substantially improve firm productivity, but that the same is not true for non-IT labor, where we find little benefit of network diversity. We hypothesize that these results reflect differences in the types of knowledge diffusion facilitated by different types of labor flows, with IT labor enabling the transfer of new and innovative firm practices, which benefits from diversity, while non-IT labor flows are more closely associated with implementation of complementary organizational practices, which may benefit from a critical mass of workers with a common knowledge base. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of incorporating a network perspective in understanding the full impact of spillover effects from organizational hiring activities.

The prediction performance is evaluated relative to a benchmark vector autoregression (VAR) model across three automotive categories and multiple prediction horizons.

We hypothesize that queue configuration may affect servers\u2019 service rate through several mechanisms: pooling may affect service rate directly as a result of social loafing effect and competition effect and indirectly via its impact on queue length. To investigate these impacts, we take advantage of the supermarket\u2019s checkout layout and use a data set containing both checkout transaction details and queue information collected from video recordings in the supermarket. After we control for the queue length, we find that servers in dedicated queues are about 10.7% faster than those in shared queues, mainly because of the social loafing effect. We also demonstrate that pooling has an indirect negative effect on service time through its impact on queue length. In addition, the queue configuration\u2019s direct effect and its indirect queue length effect function independently of each other. In aggregation, the social loafing effect dominates, and servers slow down (a 6.86% increase in service time) in shared queues.

After a consumer makes a reservation for a product (e.g., a hotel room), she is asked whether she would like to upgrade her product to a higher-quality (more expensive) one at a discounted price. The upgrade, however, is not fulfilled immediately. The firm fulfills upgrades at check-in if higher-quality products are still available, and the upgrade fee is charged to the consumer if and only if she actually gets upgraded. Consumers decide which product type to book and whether to accept an upgrade offer or not based on the anticipated upgrade probability. We find that conditional upgrades create value by improving demand\u2013supply matching for the firm. The firm can use the conditional upgrade channel to flexibly manage capacity allocations and reoptimize demand segmentation. For a firm that takes product prices as given, offering conditional upgrades is effective in compensating for the firm\u2019s lack of ability in setting prices optimally. For a firm that has the ability to optimize product prices, conditional upgrades generate higher revenues than dynamic pricing.

We also find evidence linking these results to specific synergies such as potential entry into new markets and realized synergies in the form of higher 10-K product description growth. These findings are consistent with multiple-product firms operating primarily in industries that lack language specialization.

The implications of an insurance motive on son preference are twofold. First, prior to the birth of their children, more-risk-averse parents have a stronger preference for sons than for daughters. Second, after the birth of their children, parents with sons are more risk seeking, compared to parents with daughters. We adopt a within-twin-pair fixed-effects estimator with a weak identification assumption, which enables us to jointly identify these two effects. We further conduct an incentivized choice experiment to assess parental risk attitude in a sample of Chinese twins with children, and follow up with a second twin sample to examine the replicability of the findings. In both samples, we find that parents with higher risk aversion before the birth of their children are more likely to have sons through sex selection than parents with lower risk aversion. Additionally, having sons significantly decreases parental risk aversion.

Experimental Evidence of Delegating Communication","Decision makers frequently have a spokesperson communicate their decisions. In this paper, we address two questions. First, does it matter who communicates an unfair decision? Second, does it matter how the unfair decision is communicated? We conduct a modified dictator game experiment in which either the decision maker or a spokesperson communicates the decided allocation to recipients, who then determine whether to punish either of them. We find that receivers punish both the decision maker and the spokesperson more often, and more heavily, for unfair allocations communicated by the spokesperson if there is room for shifting blame. The increased punishment results from the messenger\u2019s style of delivery: spokespersons are more likely than decision makers to express emotional regret instead of rational need.

In these studies, the size of an average job seeker\u2019s network was much smaller and limited by the available modes of communication and the costs associated with maintaining social connections. However, the recent growth of online social networks has enabled job seekers to stay connected with many connections, weak or strong. Thus, the number of online connections\u2014especially weak\u2014has increased significantly. In this paper, we first examine whether an individual\u2019s social network plays a role in driving job search behavior, taking into account online social networking sites (e.g., LinkedIn) and other job search modes. Second, we examine how ties in online social networks (both weak and strong) affect job search outcomes (modeled sequentially as job leads, interviews, and offers), and we compare the findings to job outcomes from traditional job search modes (e.g., career fairs, newspaper, Internet postings, and friends and family). To do so, we first construct an economic model of search behavior incorporating cost and benefit functions; we then estimate the model to recover structural parameters using the survey data of 424 users. Our findings show that users are spending more time searching for jobs on social networking sites. In addition, users\u2019 strong ties play a significant role in job search and are especially helpful in generating job leads, interviews, and offers; the weak ties, on average, are ineffective in generating positive outcomes and marginally negative in some cases.

The tension between these two goals has implications for the type of information that can be shared credibly. To explore the value of the information on customer types, we also study a model where the firm can observe customer types.

In this paper, we develop a stylized theoretical model to study the impact of self-order technologies on customer demand, employment levels, and restaurant profits. Our main results follow. First, customers using self-order technologies experience reduced waiting cost and increased demand, and moreover, these benefits may even carry over to customers who do not use these technologies. Second, although public opinion suggests that self-order technologies facilitate job cuts, we find instead that some firms should increase employment levels, and, paradoxically, this recommendation holds for firms with high labor costs. Finally, we find that firms should implement online (offline) self-order technology when customers have high (low) wait sensitivity.

We incorporate search cost into consumer choice models and study the two-stage consider-then-choose policy. In the first stage, a consumer forms her consideration set by balancing utility uncertainty and search cost. In the second stage, she evaluates all products in her consideration set and chooses the one with the highest net utility. We show that the revenue-ordered assortment (i.e., the offer set that includes products in the revenue-decreasing order) fails to be optimal, although it can obtain at least half the optimal revenue. We propose a k-quasi-attractiveness-ordered assortment and show that it can be arbitrarily near optimal for the market share maximization problem. The assortment problems with search cost are generally NP-hard, so we develop efficient approximation or relatively fast exact algorithms for a variety of assortment problems under the consider-then-choose models with search cost. For the joint assortment planning and pricing problem with homogeneous consumers, we show that the intrinsic-utility-ordered assortment and the quasi-same-price policy, which charges the same price for all products except at most one, are optimal.

In such settings, physicians learn about the effectiveness of a drug primarily through experimentation\u2014i.e., by initiating treatment and monitoring the patient\u2019s response. Precise guidelines for discontinuing treatment are often lacking or left entirely to the physician\u2019s discretion. We introduce a framework for developing adaptive, personalized treatments for such chronic diseases. Our model is based on a continuous-time, multi-armed bandit setting where drug effectiveness is assessed by aggregating information from several channels: by continuously monitoring the state of the patient, but also by (not) observing the occurrence of particular infrequent health events, such as relapses or disease flare-ups. Recognizing that the timing and severity of such events provide critical information for treatment decisions is a key point of departure in our framework compared with typical (bandit) models used in healthcare. We show that the model can be analyzed in closed form for several settings of interest, resulting in optimal policies that are intuitive and may have practical appeal. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology by developing a set of efficient treatment policies for multiple sclerosis, which we then use to benchmark several existing treatment guidelines.

That is, overpricing may give rise to underselling, and underpricing may yield stockout. Capacity sharing is a common practice to align excessive capacity with excessive demand. Yet, the strategic interaction between competition and capacity sharing has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we investigate optimal strategies and firm profitability of capacity sharing between competing firms under both ex ante and ex post contracting, depending on whether the capacity-sharing price is determined before or after price setting in the buyer market. We show that, with symmetric capacity, committing to an overly high capacity-sharing price may not necessarily improve firm payoffs. Capacity sharing softens price competition under either contracting scheme, whereas the optimal capacity-transfer price and equilibrium profits may be nonmonotonically influenced by buyer loyalty. The equilibrium outcome under ex ante contracting is more sensitive to variations in market parameters than ex post contracting. As a result, ex ante contracting is more likely to be preferred when the endowed capacity is low or buyer loyalty is high. However, when firms\u2019 capacity is asymmetric, capacity sharing may intensify equilibrium competition and hurt firm profitability through reversing the firms\u2019 relative pricing aggressiveness.

We develop a stylized model of online dating where agents with different outside options match based on how much they like each other. Starting from these microfoundations, we derive the strength and direction of indirect network effects and show that increasing the number of potential matches has a positive effect due to larger choice, but also a negative effect due to competition between agents on the same side. Agents resolve the trade-off between these competing effects differently, depending on their outside options. For agents with high outside options, the choice effect is stronger than the competition effect, leading them to prefer an unrestricted-choice platform. The opposite is the case for agents with low outside options, who then have higher willingness to pay for a platform restricting choice, as it also restricts the choice set of their potential matches. Moreover, since only agents with low outside options self-select into the restricted choice platform, the competition effect is mitigated further. This allows multiple platforms offering different number of choices to coexist without the market tipping.

Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms\u2019 operations decisions, financial constraints, and multiple financing channels (bank loans and trade credit), this paper attempts to better understand the risk-sharing role of trade credit\u2014that is, how trade credit enhances supply chain efficiency by allowing the retailer to partially share the demand risk with the supplier. Within this role, in equilibrium, trade credit is an indispensable external source for inventory financing, even when the supplier is at a disadvantageous position in managing default relative to a bank. Specifically, the equilibrium trade credit contract is net terms when the retailer\u2019s financial status is relatively strong. Accordingly, trade credit is the only external source that the retailer uses to finance inventory. By contrast, if the retailer\u2019s cash level is low, the supplier offers two-part terms, inducing the retailer to finance inventory with a portfolio of trade credit and bank loans. Further, a deeper early-payment discount is offered when the supplier is relatively less efficient in recovering defaulted trade credit, or the retailer has stronger market power. Trade credit allows the supplier to take advantage of the retailer\u2019s financial weakness, yet it may also benefit both parties when the retailer\u2019s cash is reasonably high. Finally, using a sample of firm-level data on retailers, we empirically observe the inventory financing pattern that is consistent with what our model predicts.

Besides monetary payoffs, we also add behavioral factors to the utility function of Sales. We model the setting as a signaling game and derive the Pareto-dominant separating equilibria of the game. In laboratory experiments, we observe human behavior that is in line with the predictions of the behavioral model but deviates substantially from expected-payoff-maximizing behavior.

Our analysis of an agent-based computational model shows that weak enforcement of even a randomly selected formal structure in a top-down manner can usefully guide the bottom-up emergence of networks of intraorganizational interactions between agents. In the absence of formal structure, interactions are prone to decline within organizations, because maintaining interactions requires coordination but breaking them does not. Formal structure regenerates the network of interactions between agents, who can then learn which interactions to keep or discard.

To address endogeneity concerns due to selection into colocation and matching, I exploit the constraints imposed on the spatial allocation of labs on the Jussieu campus of Paris by the removal of asbestos from its buildings. Consistent with search costs constituting a major friction to collaboration, colocation increases the likelihood of joint research by 3.5 times, an effect that is mostly driven by lab pairs that face higher search costs ex ante. Furthermore, separation does not negatively affect collaboration between previously colocated labs. However, while colocated labs grow increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones embark on less correlated research trajectories. Research outcomes, instead, seem to be mostly influenced by how distance affects execution costs: after colocation, labs are more likely to pursue both lower-quality projects (a selection effect) and high-quality projects (an effort effect). Opposite effects on quality are observed after separation. Whereas search costs affect which scientists are likely to collaborate together, execution costs shape the quality of their output.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that there is a stronger inclination to behave immorally in groups than individually. We ask if this is the case, and if so, why. Using a parsimonious laboratory setup, we study how individual behavior changes when deciding as a group member. We observe a strong dishonesty shift. This shift is mainly driven by communication within groups and turns out to be independent of whether group members face payoff commonality or not (i.e., whether other group members benefit from one\u2019s lie).

Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors\u2019 queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the trade-offs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated.

In particular, we document a significant U.S. institutional investor bias against firms located in Quebec relative to firms located in the rest of Canada (ROC). The differential bias is surprising given that (i) Quebec and the other Canadian provinces share the same nationality, federal law, stock exchange, and accounting standards; (ii) their regulatory filings are prepared in English and French; and (iii) U.S. institutional investors are sophisticated and located close to Quebec and the ROC. We also examine Quebec firms with different levels of French versus English online presences as well as those with CEOs who have U.S. work experience or board members or financial analysts who reside in the United States. We find that each factor affects the relative underweighting of investment in Quebec versus the ROC.

Modeling firm size is important because retail chain dynamics are more richly driven by expansion and contraction than de novo entry or permanent exit. Additionally, anticipated size spillovers may influence the strategies of forward-looking firms, making it difficult to analyze the effects of size without explicitly accounting for these in the expectations and, hence, decisions of firms. Expansion may also be profitable for some firms while detrimental for others. Thus, we explicitly model and allow for heterogeneity in the dynamic link between firm size and profits as well as potential for persistent brand effects through firm-specific unobservable factors. As a methodological contribution, we surmount the hurdle of estimating the model by extending a two-step procedure that circumvents solving the game. The first stage combines semiparametric conditional choice probability estimation with a particle filter to eliminate the serially correlated unobservable components. The second stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate the payoff parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in 1970 to 2005 provide evidence of firm-specific heterogeneity in brand effects, size spillovers, and persistence in profitability. This heterogeneous dynamic linkage shows how McDonald\u2019s becomes dominant and other chains falter as they evolve, thus affecting market structure and industry concentration.

We find a decrease in both the likelihood and the frequency of management earnings forecasts conveying bad news and an increase in the level of real earnings management following interventions by hedge fund activists. Additional evidence suggests that managers substitute between voluntary disclosure and earnings management strategies in resisting hedge fund attacks. We also find that withholding of bad news is more pronounced when hedge fund activists pose greater threats to the target firm\u2019s management and when the intervention lasts for a relatively short time period.

Buyers can therefore benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We argue that precontractual actions by a supplier, for example making costly buyer-specific investments without a long-term contract, can signal a supplier\u2019s trustworthiness. We develop a theoretical model to reflect supplier trustworthiness, and determine when a buyer can benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We show that costly relationship-specific investments can serve as a signal of trustworthiness, and that supply chain profits increase when trustworthy suppliers are able to identify themselves in this fashion. We demonstrate the importance of the signaling mechanism using laboratory experiments. The experimental results show that relationship-specific investments lead to more collaborative transactions, with buyers offering higher prices and suppliers returning higher-quality products. This results in increased profits for both buyers and suppliers. Additionally, we design a treatment which shuts down the signaling mechanism and show that the benefits of the buyer-specific investment are no longer present in this case. Finally, we show that the benefits of buyer-specific investments for both suppliers and buyers are strengthened when firms interact repeatedly.

Measuring the Effect of Consumers\u2019 Preferences on Reward Programs","Despite criticisms regarding their effectiveness, reward programs today represent a prevalent and apparently successful form of marketing investment for several industries such as airlines, hotels, gas stations, and credit cards. To understand what might contribute to their success, this paper investigates the purchase behavior of consumers who participate in a reward program from the travel industry. We estimate a dynamic demand model of gasoline purchase, and compare the value that consumers attach to rewards with the value they attach to the money spent for gasoline. We find that there exists a significant portion of frequent travelers who extract more value from one dollar\u2019s worth of rewards than from one dollar spent for gasoline. Most of the effectiveness of the reward program is due to the behavior of these consumers. Their insensitivity to price induces firms to increase fuel prices by 1 euro cent per liter, which corresponds to about 10% increase in their margins. The program also contributes to softening competition, increasing margins by 4%. The web appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2821.

In contrast to prior research, we show that discussion can either aid or impede accuracy relative to the averaging of collaborators\u2019 independent judgments, as a systematic function of task type and interaction process. For estimation tasks with a wide range of potential estimates, discussion aided accuracy by helping participants prevent and eliminate egregious errors. For estimation tasks with a naturally bounded range, discussion following independent estimates performed on par with averaging. Importantly, if participants did not first make independent estimates, discussion greatly harmed accuracy by limiting the range of considered estimates, independent of task type. Our research shows that discussion can be a powerful tool for error reduction, but only when appropriately structured: Decision makers should form independent judgments to consider a wide range of possible answers, and then use discussion to eliminate extremely large errors.

In other words, a UAV picks up a package from the truck (which continues on its route), and after delivering the package, the UAV returns to the truck to pick up the next package. Although the hardware for such systems already exists, the extent to which such an approach can actually provide a significantly improved quality of service is not yet understood. By combining a theoretical analysis in the Euclidean plane with real-time numerical simulations on a road network, we demonstrate that the improvement in efficiency is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the speeds of the truck and the UAV.

The principal, therefore, devises a mechanism involving payments and a potential stopping time to motivate the agent to always exert effort. We formulate this problem as a stochastic optimal control model with an incentive constraint in continuous time over an infinite horizon.

Managers also differentially guide forecasts to improve accuracy. Whereas unmanaged forecast errors are much larger for high-price firms, they are compressed to the point their magnitudes resemble those for low-price firms. Managers also guide analyst forecasts to generate patterns of forecast walkdowns that again vary with share price.

Empirical evidence suggests that consumers care about not only the consumption utility derived from a product, but also the gain\u2013loss utility in comparison to the reference product of the category. This paper examines how reference-dependent utility affects price competition in a horizontally differentiated market where consumers\u2019 tastes are diverse. When consumer valuations are low, the reference product is priced lower than a nonreference product. In contrast, when consumer valuations are high, the reference product is priced higher than a nonreference product. Moreover, loss aversion on the price dimension always intensifies competition among low-valuation goods, whereas loss aversion on the taste dimension softens competition among high-valuation goods only if consumer sensitivity to the difference in match quality is above a threshold. We also find that an increase in the diversity of consumers\u2019 tastes reduces equilibrium profits if consumer valuation is low but has the opposite effect if consumer valuation is high. We further explore how an increase in the popularity of the reference product affects price competition.

The first, purchase order financing (POF), allows financial institutions to offer loans to suppliers by considering the value of purchase orders issued by reputable buyers. Under the second, which we call buyer direct financing (BDF), manufacturers issue both sourcing contracts and loans directly to suppliers. Both schemes are closely related to the supplier\u2019s performance risk (whether the supplier can deliver the order successfully), upon which the repayment of these loans hinges. To understand the relative efficiency of the two emerging schemes, we analyze a game-theoretical model that captures the interactions among three parties (a manufacturer, a financially constrained supplier who can exert unobservable effort to improve delivery reliability, and a bank). We find that, when the manufacturer and the bank have symmetric information, POF and BDF yield the same payoffs for all parties irrespective of the manufacturer\u2019s control advantage under BDF. The manufacturer, however, has more flexibility under BDF in selecting contract terms. In addition, even when the manufacturer has superior information about the supplier\u2019s operational capability, the manufacturer can efficiently signal her private information via the sourcing contract if the supplier\u2019s asset level is not too low. As such, POF remains an attractive financing option. However, if the supplier is severely financially constrained, the manufacturer\u2019s information advantage makes BDF the preferred financing scheme when contracting with an efficient supplier. In particular, the relative benefit of BDF (over POF) is more pronounced when the supply market contains a larger proportion of inefficient suppliers, when differences in efficiency between suppliers are greater, or when the manufacturer\u2019s alternative sourcing option is more expensive.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0638","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['financial constraints', 'performance risk', 'suppliers']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financing schemes for suppliers and does not emphasize social justice or ethical considerations.

We find that suppliers with smaller market share are associated with more trade credit, confirming that suppliers with weak market power use trade credit as a competitive tool. Next, we find that buyers with larger market share are associated with more trade credit, whereas suppliers selling to a concentrated buyer base are associated with less trade credit; by differentiating competition in buyers\u2019 markets from competition between supply chain partners, we show that the two types of competition have different impacts on trade credit. In studying the impact of trade credit on firm performance, we make the distinction between an industry-average trade credit and an individual supply chain\u2019s deviation from such an industry average. When suppliers offer trade credit at their industry-average level, this action facilitates trade and, thus, is positively associated with both parties\u2019 performance; conversely, when suppliers are more aggressive in their trade credit strategy than the industry average, then the excess trade credit is negatively associated with buyer performance. One managerial message from our research is that buyers should be cautious about trade credit far exceeding the industry-average level.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0640","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on trade credit and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The firm has two operationally independent production facilities, each of which makes two products, and a cash reserve that finances all operations and dividend issuance. Each period the firm chooses the amount of dividend to issue, and at each facility it chooses production quantities and amounts of capacity to augment or divest. Relevant market data are exogenous and evolve stochastically. We completely characterize the optimal policy and the endogenous values of the capacities and cash reserve, and show that they invite a real-option interpretation. We find that internal financing creates a spillover between the endogenous values of the two operationally independent facilities, and we specify how this leads to interdependence of their optimal policies. We show that an \u201cinvest/stay put/divest\u201d (ISD) policy remains optimal for partially irreversible investments, but internal financing changes the ISD thresholds. If the exogenous data are intertemporally independent, an internally financed firm is less likely to issue dividends or to expand capacity than if it were in a perfect capital market. As the market becomes more volatile, the endogenous values of capacities and cash increase, and the firm becomes more reluctant to issue dividends.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0655","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production management and internal financing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Mild cost fluctuations merely affect firms\u2019 profitability. Significant variations can lead to supply chain disruption. What are the best contracts to be used in supply chains exposed to fluctuating raw material costs? We ask this question in two contexts\u2014in the presence and the absence of working capital constraint. Academic/practical relevance: We add a framework on how to optimally contract in the presence of stochastic costs and working capital constraints and help managers understand how they can increase profitability. Methodology: We present a game-theoretic study of a bilateral monopoly supply chain with stochastic demand, stochastic input costs, production lead times, and working capital constraints. The upstream firm announces a supply contract to which the downstream firm responds with an order quantity. The contract is a single-price, multi-instrument contract with optional default penalties. Many previously studied coordinating contracts, as well as some noncoordinating ones, are special cases of our general contract. Results: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions that the instruments of the general contract must satisfy for the contract to induce a coordinated outcome\u2014both with and without working capital constraints. Then we translate these requirements into implementable contracts. Indexing (I) on raw material prices and using default penalties (Ps) is necessary, and an I&P revenue-sharing contract turns out to be the most versatile contract for these environments. Managerial implications: We provide clear guidelines on how to contract in situations where production costs of every supply chain member fluctuate significantly, possibly in the presence of working capital constraints.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0660","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and profitability without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

First, knowledge spillover among firms enables free dissemination of new technologies and produces investment synergies. Second, knowledge spillover also causes free riding: in equilibrium, firms underinvest in R&D expecting to benefit from investments by others. Third, debt financing creates incentive for risk shifting: equity holders overinvest in riskier R&D projects. We study how interactions among these forces affect a firm\u2019s investment decisions and equilibrium industry outcomes using a three-stage game between two firms and the external debt market. We characterize subgame perfect, Pareto-dominant equilibria and show that for some parameter choices, free riding and risk shifting cancel each other in the decisions of individual firms, resulting in the first-best investments. Interestingly, for some cases, the equilibrium with first-best investments becomes possible only when risk shifting by one firm enables free riding by the other firm. We also show that debt can be used by firms as a commitment device in a multistage game. This value of debt is shared with investors, who can earn positive profits despite being perfectly competitive. This enriches the understanding of the financial pecking order theory by showing that even firms with unlimited internal capital may prefer external debt financing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0668","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical economic forces related to R&D investments and does not address any social justice, equity, or ethical themes.

Impact of Credit Ratings on Supply Chain Decisions","Problem description: We study the impact of credit ratings on operational and financial decisions of a supply chain with a supplier and a retailer interacting via an early payment discount contract. The retailer has a single opportunity to order a product from the supplier to satisfy future uncertain demand. Both the retailer and supplier are capital constrained, and the retailer can use both short-term bank loans and trade credits for his financing needs, while the supplier can use short-term bank loans and/or the retailers early payment. We analyze for all relevant operational decisions (wholesale price, trade credit rates, bank loans, and order quantity) for capital-constrained firms. Academic/practical relevance: We add a framework on who should finance inventories, and at what rates, in the presence of differential credit ratings of the supply chain parties. Methodology: Within a modified selling to the newsvendor Stackelberg game with the supplier as the leader, we derive the equilibrium trade credit rates, wholesale price, bank loans, and order quantity. Results: We show there exists a threshold such that if the supplier\u2019s credit rating is above it, then the supplier offers trade credits with zero interest rate and the retailer uses trade credits only. Otherwise, the supplier sets a positive rate, which motivates the retailer to combine trade credits and bank loans. The supplier always benefits from working with good rating retailers. A retailer prefers to work with suppliers outside the supplier\u2019s credit rating hole (a finite set of ratings) over suppliers with ratings within the range. Managerial implications: We provide insights on who should finance supply chain inventories and at what rates when there are differential credit rating between the supplier and retailer. We provide a plausible explanation for the practice of large and good credit rating retailers maintaining a small cash ratio and working with small suppliers in developing countries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0669","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['credit ratings', 'capital constrained', 'supplier', 'retailer']","The article primarily focuses on financial and operational decisions related to credit ratings in supply chains without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The firm optimizes both its capacity investment under demand uncertainty and its sourcing of funds from a competitive investor. Ours is the first study of this problem to adopt an optimal contracting approach: feasible sources of funds are derived endogenously from fundamentals and include standard financial claims (debt, equity, convertible debt, etc.). Thus, in contrast to most of the literature on financing capacity investments, our results are robust to a change of financial contract. We characterize the optimal capacity level under optimal financing. First, we find conditions under which a feasible financial contract exists that leads to the first-best capacity. When no such contract exists, we find that under optimal financing, the choice of capacity sometimes exceeds strictly the efficient level. Furthermore, the firm invests more when its cash is low, and in some cases less when the project\u2019s unit revenue is high. These results run counter to the newsvendor logic and standard finance arguments. We also show that our main results hold in the case of a strategic monopolist investor, and such an investor may invest more then a competitive one.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0671","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial frictions and optimal contracting without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper fills the literature gap by comparing buyer finance with bank finance in a supply chain with one assembler and multiple heterogeneous capital-constrained component suppliers. We characterize the equilibrium solutions for different financing schemes (i.e., buyer finance, bank finance, and no finance). We show that in buyer finance the assembler should charge the suppliers the lowest possible interest rate, which may be even below its own unit capital opportunity cost, leading to interest losses in financing suppliers. However, the assembler can benefit more from enhanced inventory backup and lower component purchasing prices resulting from the low buyer-finance interest rate. We further compare the two financing schemes from the perspectives of the assembler, the borrowing and nonborrowing suppliers, and the whole supply chain. Our analysis reveals that the assembler may offer buyer finance even if its own unit capital opportunity cost is higher than the bank risk-free interest rate. We also demonstrate how the suppliers\u2019 initial capitals, production costs, and their heterogeneities affect the assembler\u2019s selection of the optimal financing scheme and identify the conditions under which buyer finance is better than bank finance for different parties in this assembly supply chain.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0677","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['finance', 'suppliers', 'supply chain']","The article primarily focuses on financial mechanisms within supply chains without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine a technology supplier\u2019s licensing decision in such emerging multiparty networked supply chains in which a downstream design firm\u2019s capability may not be publicly known. We find that the supply chain and firm profits are critically affected by whether or not a license agreement between a technology supplier and a design firm is kept confidential from a manufacturer. Instead of licensing to two downstream firms, a technology supplier may also license to an integrated firm with both design and manufacturing capabilities, which forms a conventional vertical supply chain. We compare a networked supply chain with a vertical supply chain and show that the network model can, under some conditions, outperform the integrated configuration and increase profits for all supply chain entities. In particular, a downstream firm can be better off decentralized, with design and manufacturing functions taken by different firms.

With the increasing length and complexity of today\u2019s global supply chains, the buyer may face two issues when designing the sourcing contract: adverse selection (i.e., the supplier\u2019s cost structure is private information) and noncontractible capacity (i.e., the supplier\u2019s capacity investment is not contractible). We show that noncontractible capacity does not necessarily lead to a lower profit for the buyer, but it may require a more complex contract format to achieve the optimal (second-best) profit. Interestingly, we find that a single, linear contract (or a two-part tariff) could be optimal for the buyer under certain conditions. Even when such a contract is suboptimal, it can deliver close-to-optimal profit for the buyer for a wide range of situations. These findings indicate that the value of using a complex menu of contracts is negligible in such a supply chain setting. A simple two-part tariff is an attractive option for buyers whose goal is to ensure supply while facing both cost uncertainty and contractibility issues. The paper also provides a new explanation for the prevalence of such simple contracts in practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0628","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and contract design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The test auction reveals incumbent supplier cost information that helps the buyer determine how many entrants (if any) to recruit at a cost prior to awarding the remaining units. The optimal number of entrant suppliers to recruit follows a threshold policy that is monotonic in the test auction\u2019s clearing price unless the underlying supplier cost distribution is not regular. When setting her reserve price in the test auction, the buyer uses supplier recruitment as her \u201coutside option\u201d: if the reserve price is not met in the test auction, the buyer recruits new suppliers and runs a second auction. We compare the attractiveness of the test auction procedure relative to the more conventional procedure in which the buyer auctions off her entire demand in one auction.

Demand substitution exists between the two products (interproduct substitution) and may also exist across different time periods (intertemporal substitution). However, there is limited demand information such that the underlying probability distributions of the demand cannot be characterized precisely. We use an interval to represent, respectively, the demand for each individual product in each period, the aggregate demand for the two products in each period, and the total aggregate demand for the two products across multiple time periods. We propose a robust optimization model for this problem to maximize the worst-case total revenue. For the problem with interproduct demand substitution only, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm and show that the search spaces in the DP can be reduced greatly, which enables the algorithm to generate optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. For the problem with both interproduct and intertemporal demand substitutions, we develop a more complex dynamic programming algorithm and design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme that guarantees a proven, near optimal solution in a manageable computation time for practically sized problems. Our computational results show that, compared to a risk-neutral approach, our robust optimization approach can decrease the variance of the revenue at a small expense of the average revenue. We also generate a number of managerial insights: (i) none of the key structural properties commonly studied in the pricing literature hold for our problem; (ii) the revenue impact of ignoring intertemporal demand substitution when such substitution exists can be quite significant; and (iii) under- or overestimating the bounds of the demand intervals or imposing moderate business rules leads to relatively small revenue loss, typically less than 3%.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0639","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and optimization without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The e-tailer faces a joint pricing and fulfillment (JPF) optimization problem: at the beginning of each period, the e-tailer needs to jointly decide the price for each product and how to fulfill an incoming order (i.e., from which warehouse to ship the order). The objective of the e-tailer is to maximize its total expected profits defined as total expected revenues minus total expected shipping costs. (All other costs are fixed in this problem.) The exact optimal policy for JPF is difficult to solve; so, we propose two heuristic controls that have provably good performance compared to reasonable benchmarks. Our first heuristic control directly uses the solution of a deterministic approximation of JPF as its control parameters. Our second heuristic control improves the first one by adaptively adjusting the original control parameters according to the realized demand. An important feature of the second heuristic control is that it decouples the real-time pricing and fulfillment decisions, making it easy to implement. We show theoretically and numerically that the second heuristic control significantly outperforms the first heuristic control and is very close to a benchmark that jointly reoptimizes the full deterministic problem at the beginning of every period.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0641","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and fulfillment optimization without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In such systems, customers typically hang up and abandon the system if their wait for service is too long. Such abandonments are detrimental for the system, and so managers typically use scheduling as a tool to mitigate it. In this paper, we study the interplay between customer impatience and scheduling decisions when managing heterogeneous customer classes. Academic/practical relevance: Call centers constitute a large industry that has a global spending of around $300 billion and employs more than 15 million people worldwide. Our work focuses on improving call center operations, which can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Mathematically, customer patience is typically modeled as exponentially distributed for tractability. Our work makes inroads into relaxing this restrictive assumption to allow modeling more realistic call center situations. Methodology: We use heavy traffic\u2013motivated asymptotic queueing machinery that provides us the traction to successfully capture and incorporate the customer impatience distribution into the scheduling problem. In our approach, the scheduling problem reduces to a diffusion control problem, which we solve to propose near-optimal scheduling policies. Results: We propose near-optimal scheduling policies that can be implemented by call centers to improve their quality-of-service metrics. One of our main results is that, for a class of parameters, we establish sufficient conditions for both the optimality and nonoptimality of threshold policies. Managerial implications: Threshold policies are widely used for scheduling. Our work provides additional insight into whether these may be suboptimal. Our work provides an easy-to-implement alternative that can reduce customer abandonments considerably; for instance, our numerical results indicate that for a system with two customer types, the abandonment rate of one class can be lowered by 30% by using our policy relative to the best threshold policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0642","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling in service systems without addressing any social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

We study the manufacturers\u2019 price-setting interactions and how these can be manipulated by the retailer\u2019s assortment strategy. We show that constraining the breadth of the assortment has two main effects on retailer profits: First, a larger assortment may intensify competitive pressure and decrease prices because manufacturers need to fight harder for market share. Second, a smaller assortment may also reduce manufacturer prices because manufacturers want to ensure that they are included in the chosen assortment, which may lead to higher profits despite lower variety and possibly lower revenues. We optimize retailer assortment strategies, taking into account these two effects. We find that when the manufacturers\u2019 products are very different in terms of attractiveness, the first effect dominates while the second effect is stronger when products are comparable. Finally, our findings require that retailers communicate the assortment strategy properly: retailers should not disclose the identity of the chosen manufacturers, but should commit to a given assortment breadth.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0643","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of assortment planning and manufacturer competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we consider problems of allocating a carshare fleet to service zones under uncertain one-way and round-trip rental demand. We employ a two-stage stochastic integer programming model, in the first stage of which we allocate shared vehicle fleet and purchase parking lots or permits in reservation-based or free-floating systems. In the second stage, we generate a finite set of samples to represent demand uncertainty and construct a spatial\u2013temporal network for each sample to model vehicle movement and the corresponding rental revenue, operating cost, and penalties from unserved demand. We minimize the expected total costs minus profit and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with mixed-integer, rounding-enhanced Benders cuts, which can significantly improve computation efficiency when implemented in parallel computing. We apply our model to a data set of Zipcar in the Boston\u2013Cambridge, Massachusetts, area to demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches and draw insights on carshare management. Our results show that exogenously given one-way demand can increase carshare profitability under given one-way and round-trip price differences and vehicle relocation cost whereas endogenously generated one-way demand as a result of pricing and strategic customer behavior may decrease carshare profitability. Our model can also be applied in a rolling-horizon framework to deliver optimized vehicle relocation decisions and achieve significant improvement over an intuitive fleet-rebalancing policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0644","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['mobility', 'carbon emissions', 'service zones']","The article discusses carsharing as a means to increase mobility and reduce carbon emissions, which indicates some awareness of environmental sustainability.

In this paper we consider the dynamic risk management problem for a commodity processor operating in a partially complete market, facing both price uncertainty and significant financial distress costs. The firm procures an input commodity, processes it to produce an output commodity, and trades the output commodity in each period over a multiperiod horizon. The firm\u2019s objective is to dynamically and jointly plan operational and financial hedging decisions to maximize the market-based value of cash flows under a time-consistent risk measure. We show that the optimal operational policy has the same price and horizon dependent threshold structure that obtains when markets are complete. We also characterize conditions under which a myopic policy is optimal. We present numerical studies to illustrate that (i) compared to using a myopic policy or a policy that neglects to model financial distress costs, the advantage of using the optimal policy is significant for firms that face moderate financial distress costs and have excess procurement capacity; (ii) more acute financial distress costs reduce the firm\u2019s market-based value and throughput; and (iii) financial hedging provides considerable benefit by reducing the incidence of large negative cash flows.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0647","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of risk management and financial distress in commodity operations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To manage such multiproduct systems, firms need to make two sets of decisions. The first one requires setting an inventory target for each product, and the second requires dynamically allocating the scarce capacity among the products. It is not known how to make these decisions optimally. In this paper, we propose easily implementable policies that have both theoretical and practical appeal. We first suggest simple and intuitive allocation rules that determine how such scarce capacity is shared. Given such rules, we calculate the optimal inventory target for each product. We demonstrate analytically that our policies are optimal under two asymptotic regimes represented by high service levels (i.e., high shortage costs) and heavy traffic (i.e., tight capacity). We also demonstrate that our policies outperform current known policies over a wide range of problem parameters. In particular, the cost savings from our policies become more significant as the capacity gets more restrictive.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0648","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managing capacity in operations without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, recent studies suggest an association between the age of transfused RBCs and adverse clinical outcomes for their recipients. Therefore, there is an interest in inventory management policies that could reduce the age of transfused RBCs without compromising their availability. In this work, we study the performance of a practical family of threshold-based allocation policies, designed to trade off the age of RBC transfusions with their availability at hospitals. To this end, we consider a stylized model of a hospital blood bank that procures its required blood from local donations. For this model, we develop a new method to exactly evaluate the performance of the threshold policy in terms of the distribution of the age of allocated units and the proportion of outdates and lost demand. Through numerical and structural results, we obtain new insights on the performance of the threshold policy and in particular on how it compares with shortening the shelf life of RBCs (e.g., from 42 to 28 days). We verify and discuss the robustness of these results to the model assumptions in a simulation study calibrated using data from a Canadian hospital blood bank.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0650","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management for red blood cells, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

As a benchmark, we first consider the independent audit-penalty mechanism in which the buyers conduct their respective audits and impose penalties independently. We then examine the implications of two new audit-penalty mechanisms that entail a collective penalty. The first is the joint mechanism under which buyers conduct audits jointly, share the total audit cost incurred, and impose a collective penalty if the supplier fails their joint audit. The second is the shared mechanism in which each buyer conducts audits independently, shares its audit reports with the other buyers, and imposes a collective penalty if the supplier fails any one of the audits. Using a simultaneous-move game-theoretic model with two buyers and one supplier, our analysis reveals that both the joint and the shared mechanisms are beneficial in several ways. First, when the wholesale price is exogenously given, we establish the following analytical results for the joint mechanism in comparison with the independent mechanism: (a) the supplier\u2019s compliance level is higher; (b) the supplier\u2019s profit is lower while the buyers\u2019 profits are higher; and (c) when the buyers\u2019 damage cost is high, the joint audit mechanism creates supply chain value so the buyers can offer an appropriate transfer payment to make the supplier better off. Second, for the shared audit mechanism, we establish similar results but under more restrictive conditions. Finally, when the wholesale price is endogenously determined by the buyers, our numerical analysis shows that the key results continue to hold.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0653","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['compliance', 'audits', 'penalty']","The article discusses supplier compliance and audit mechanisms, which relate to ethical business practices, but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

The first stage employs a novel dynamic transmission model to forecast the occurrence of new cases at the region level, capturing connectivity among regions. We introduce an empirically estimated coefficient for behavioral adaptation to changing epidemic conditions. The second stage compares four approaches to allocate units across affected regions: (i) a heuristic based on observed cases, (ii) a greedy policy that prioritizes regions based on the reproductive number, (iii) a myopic linear program that allocates resources in the next period based on an iterative estimation\u2013optimization approach coupled with the underlying epidemic model, and (iv) an approximate dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes over all future periods.

The firm decides whether to unbundle the ancillary service from the main service and charge separate prices for different service components. We study the interaction between the optimal ancillary unbundling strategy and the firm\u2019s use of main service price discrimination by analyzing two types of firms: firms that use uniform pricing of main service and firms that use discriminatory pricing of main service. We find that a uniform-pricing (respectively, discriminatory-pricing) firm should unbundle the ancillary service if the fraction of high-type consumers who value the ancillary service is large (respectively, small) enough. The difference hinges on the rationale that under uniform pricing, unbundling allows the firm to extract more ancillary surplus from high-type consumers; by contrast, under discriminatory pricing, bundling allows the firm to extract more ancillary surplus from consumers. Moreover, we find that unbundling the ancillary service and using main service price discrimination are strategic complements (respectively, strategic substitutes) if the correlation between consumers\u2019 main service valuations and ancillary service valuations is low (respectively, high).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0646","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies and consumer types without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In addition to ambulance redeployment, we consider a general dispatching and relocation strategy by which the decision maker has the option to (i) select any available ambulance to dispatch to a call or to queue the call and (ii) send an idle ambulance to cover the location of an ambulance just dispatched to a call. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program, and, because the state space is unbounded, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework is developed to generate high-quality solutions. We assess the quality of our solutions by developing a lower bound on the expected response time and computing a lower bound on the expected fraction of late calls of any relocation policy. We test the performance of our policies and available benchmarks on an emergency medical services system in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The results show that our policies are near optimal and significantly outperform available benchmarks. In particular, our ADP policy reduces the expected response time and fraction of high-priority late calls by 12% and 30.6%, respectively, over the best available static benchmarks in the case study. Moreover, the results provide insights on the contribution of each dispatching, redeployment, and reallocation strategy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0649","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['optimization', 'response time', 'emergency medical services']","The article focuses primarily on technical optimization methods for ambulance dispatching without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

Each firm determines its unit price. The retailer orders the product from the manufacturer prior to the beginning of the selling periods. We consider two types of customers: (1) strategic customers who take their future options into account and time their purchases accordingly and (2) myopic customers who consider only their current options. We compare the resulting equilibria for these two scenarios and evaluate the impact of customers\u2019 strategic behavior. We find that strategic customer behavior always benefits the manufacturer. Interestingly, it may also improve the profitability of the retailer and the entire supply chain in some cases. Strategic customer behavior and decentralization are often regarded as detriments to supply chain performance. We find that, however, the combination of these two factors may not result in the worst supply chain performance. When customers are sufficiently patient, a decentralized supply chain that faces strategic customers actually outperforms the supply chain with only one of those factors at play. Finally, we show that when customers are strategic, the retailer\u2019s and manufacturer\u2019s profits with price commitment, availability commitment, or quick response can be lower than those when customers are myopic.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0651","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and customer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Managing Supplier Quality Under Information Asymmetry","Despite the many benefits of outsourcing, firms are still concerned about the lack of critical information regarding both the risk levels and actions of their suppliers, who are usually just a few links away. Usually, companies manage supply chain risks by deferring payments to suppliers until after the delivery has been made. Even though the deferred payment approach shunts the risk from the buyer to the supplier, recent supply chain failures suggest that it does not necessarily eliminate the risk completely. Hence, many companies offer incentives and conduct inspections of the actions taken at the source rather than waiting for the end delivery. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of such incentive and inspection mechanisms undertaken by manufacturers to manage the quality of suppliers who are \u201cprivately\u201d aware of the risk of failure. By comparing the agency costs associated with each contractual setting, we characterize the value of output- and action-based incentive mechanisms from the perspective of the manufacturer. We find that employing action-based incentives is effective for the manufacturer, specifically when working with a supplier that faces high costs of production and quality improvement. However, if the manufacturer faces high inspection costs or a low degree of information asymmetry, employing an output-based contract that results in differentiated quality improvement efforts becomes more effective. Finally, we analyze the marginal value of the combined contracting strategy and characterize when it strictly dominates over output- and effort-based contracts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0652","","MSOM","Operations Management","2","['supply chain', 'risk', 'incentives']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain management and risk mitigation without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

In theory, a number of different contracts can solve this issue and induce first-best investment levels by the supplier. In this study, we investigate the performance of these contracts in a two-tier supply chain. We develop an experimental design where retailers and suppliers bargain over contract terms\u2014and have the ability to make multiple back-and-forth offers\u2014while also providing feedback on the offers they receive. One key result from our study is that an option contract and a service-level agreement are best at increasing first-best investment levels and overall supply chain profits. However, these same contracts also generate the largest inequity in expected profits between the two parties. We find that both of these results are driven by the bargaining tendencies of retailers and suppliers, which we refer to as \u201csuperficial fairness.\u201d In particular, retailers and suppliers place more emphasis on negotiating the wholesale price, while partially overlooking any secondary parameter, such that final wholesale prices end up roughly halfway between the retailer\u2019s selling price and the supplier\u2019s production cost. We show that this bargaining behavior contributes to higher investment levels observed in the option contract and service-level agreement, along with the inequitable payoffs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0654","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['equity', 'bargaining', 'investment']","The article discusses the inequity in expected profits between suppliers and retailers, hinting at themes of fairness and equity in business negotiations.

When the replenishment is outsourced to an outside vendor, the replenishment cost is typically additive. However, when it is done by in-house operations, the replenishment cost is a submodular function of the set of ATMs being replenished. The additive replenishment cost function yields a tractable and separable inventory management problem. However, the submodular cost function creates a much harder problem. We construct a Markov decision process model and study the structure of the optimal strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost. Since the optimal policy is analytically and computationally intractable for the case of a large number of ATMs, we study a heuristic policy (called the index policy) in the case of submodular replenishment costs. We find that the index policy performs close to the optimal policy (when it can be computed) and performs much better than the benchmark (namely, an (s, M) policy) in general. We demonstrate similar findings in a real-world data set with 139 ATMs and 20 months of historical demand data.

Such patients tend to have higher mortality rates and longer lengths of stay than direct admissions to the ICU. As such, the medical community has invested substantial efforts in the development of patient risk scores with the intent to identify patients at risk of deterioration. In this work, we consider how one such risk score could be used to trigger proactive transfers to the ICU. We utilize a retrospective data set from 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals to estimate the potential benefit of transferring patients to the ICU at various levels of patient risk of deterioration. To reduce the sensitivity of our findings to key identification and modeling assumptions, we use a combination of multivariate matching and instrumental variable approaches. Using our empirical results to calibrate a simulation model, we find that proactively transferring the most severe patients could reduce mortality rates and lengths of stay without increasing other adverse events; however, proactive transfers should be used judiciously, as being too aggressive could increase ICU congestion and degrade quality of care.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0658","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of patient transfers and risk assessment without addressing social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

Each customer arrives with a preference list and will purchase the highest-ranking offered product in her preference list. We assume the set of customer classes is derived from paths in a tree, in which the order of nodes visited along each path gives the corresponding preference list. First, we study assortment problems, in which the goal is to find which products to offer to maximize expected revenue. We give a dynamic programming solution, which can be extended to versions of the assortment problem in which there are fixed costs for offering a product, shelf constraints, or substitution costs. Second, we study the joint assortment and pricing problem, in which the goal is to simultaneously select the set of offered products as well as their prices. We solve the pricing problem optimally when customers have some universal ranking of the products, and hence the tree takes the form of a single path. We also solve the problem optimally on the general tree when the prices are restricted to be quality consistent; higher-quality products must be priced above lower-quality products. Finally, we present computational experiments on both synthetic data and real hotel purchase data. Our estimation procedure shows both how to build the tree of products and how to estimate the underlying arrival probabilities of each customer type from historical sales data. These experiments show that the tree choice model captures customer purchasing behavior more accurately than the multinomial logit choice model in the majority of test cases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0662","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of assortment optimization and pricing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The contract can only be awarded to a supplier who passes a multistage qualification process. For each stage of the qualification process, the buyer incurs a fixed testing cost for each supplier she chooses to test. The buyer seeks an optimal mechanism\u2014that is, one that minimizes her total expected cost. Motivated by the buyer\u2019s urgency (or the lack of it) of time for completing the qualification process, we obtain optimal mechanisms for two testing environments: (1) simultaneous testing, where in each stage, the buyer selects a subset of those suppliers who have passed all the previous stages and tests them simultaneously; and (2) nonsimultaneous testing, where the simultaneous-testing requirement is not imposed. Under simultaneous testing, the admission policy for selecting suppliers at each stage is based on nonuniform reserve-price thresholds. Under nonsimultaneous testing, too, the admission policy is threshold based, but the selection process is sequential in nature. The relative increase in cost due to the simultaneous-testing requirement is (under a mild condition) monotonically increasing in the number of suppliers, the expected multistage testing cost, and the overall passing probability. We also study the optimal sequencing of the qualification stages and show that the buyer should schedule the stages in increasing order of the ratio of their testing cost to their failing probability. Finally, for the simpler setting of a single-stage qualification process and a single supplier, we study a two-dimensional mechanism design problem where, in addition to cost, the passing probability is also private to the supplier. Here, too, threshold-based admission remains optimal, and the buyer offers either a pooling or a separating contract.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0664","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of procurement auctions and supplier qualification without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The data set has the distinguishing feature of reflecting actual decisions that the firms made recently (during the last three years). Results: Companies are currently restructuring their global production footprints. The majority of firms engage in offshoring. Reshoring does occur but seldom for corrective reasons. China remains the most attractive site for production sourcing, followed by Eastern Europe and Southern Asia. Manufacturing continues to decline in the developed economies of Japan and Western Europe. We observe that while North America may be at the cusp of a manufacturing renaissance, such a change is not just because of reshoring by domestic firms. Labor cost no longer dominates manufacturing location decisions; rather, firms decide based on complex trade-offs among a variety of factors. Finally, firms localize production in developed economies and use developing economies as production hubs. Managerial implications: Our goal in this paper is to inform both managerial policy decisions and the academic research agenda by developing insights on managerial practices that concern production sourcing and on the factors that drive such decisions. We develop hypotheses concerning how firms make these strategy decisions, and we discuss implications for analytical and empirical research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0666","","MSOM","Operations Management","3","['global supply chain', 'reshoring', 'manufacturing', 'labor cost']","The article discusses global production sourcing decisions and the implications of offshoring and reshoring, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

We investigate what will happen when prospect theory (e.g., reference prices) meets consumer choice models from the perspectives of both the consumers and the firm. Academic/practical relevance: Consumers see multiple relevant products on a particular purchase occasion and often compare their prices to form the willingness to pay when considering whether to purchase a particular product. Reference prices, which are not included in many choice models, may impact consumer choice behavior, so we incorporate reference prices into consumer choice models and investigate the operations management problems. Methodology: We take the widely used multinomial logit model as a showcase to examine the effects of reference prices through analytical and empirical study. We consider the optimization problems on assortment planning and pricing under consumer choice models with a variety of reference prices, including the lowest price and the assortment variety. Results: Our empirical study on a real data set demonstrates that incorporating reference prices into choice models can significantly improve goodness of fit and prediction accuracy of consumer choice behavior. Moreover, we characterize the optimal policies for the assortment planning and pricing problems under the consumer choice models with various reference prices. In particular, for the pricing problems under the reference prices defined by either the lowest price or assortment variety, we show that the optimal pricing policy has the following structure: products can be divided into several groups based on their costs; the products in the same group charge either the same markup or the same price.

The owner then decides the inventory level and the mix of debt and equity with which to finance the firm\u2019s operations. Our model captures the practical features of ABL, for example, the bank does not have the full knowledge of the firm\u2019s demand prospects, and the inventory advance rate leads to a credit limit that increases in the firm\u2019s inventory investment. Results: We show that ABL enables the bank to mitigate information asymmetry by screening firms and thereby controlling each firm type\u2019s order quantity and leverage. We also obtain hypotheses describing the equilibrium loan contracts, capital structure, inventory investment, and bankruptcy outcomes. For instance, leverage leads to overinvestment resulting from the equity decision being endogenous to the model. Moreover, inventory advance rates are more sensitive to firms\u2019 operational characteristics than interest rates. Managerial implications: Our study sheds light on the operational and financial implications of ABL by demonstrating how managers should make inventory and capital structure decisions while interacting with asset-based lenders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0670","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset-based lending and operational characteristics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, the stringency of emissions regulation varies across regions, raising concerns over carbon leakage\u2014an outcome where stringent regulation in one region shifts production to regions with weaker regulation. It is believed that such leakage adversely increases global emissions. It is also believed that leakage can be eliminated by carbon tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods so that they incur the same emissions cost that they would have if they had been produced in the regulated region. Results here contradict these beliefs. This paper demonstrates that carbon leakage can arise despite a carbon tariff but, when it does arise under a carbon tariff, it decreases emissions. Due in part to this clean leakage, results here indicate that a carbon tariff decreases global emissions. Domestic firm profits, on the other hand, can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged due to a carbon tariff, which suggests that carbon tariffs are not inherently protectionist as some argue. Rather, results here suggest that carbon tariffs improve the efficacy of emissions regulation, enabling it to reduce global emissions in many settings in which it would otherwise fail to do so.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0674","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['emissions regulation', 'climate change', 'carbon tariffs']","The article discusses emissions regulation and carbon tariffs, which are related to environmental sustainability and climate change, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility.

Academic/practical relevance: Motivated by the steady growth in noncash donations from U.S. companies, our work is the first to provide theoretical guidance on operational planning under tax deduction for both precommitted donations and end-of-season donations. Methodology: We analyze the impact of tax deduction for a profit-driven firm under a two-period price-markdown newsvendor model and characterize the firm\u2019s optimal price and quantity decisions. Results: The firm\u2019s optimal donation behavior is driven by two factors\u2014fixed cost and demand uncertainty. Specifically, a positive fixed cost can induce precommitted donation during the regular selling season, and demand uncertainty can induce end-of-season donation during the clearance period. Managerial insights: The enhanced tax deduction that is designed to encourage charitable donations results in unexpected behavior by the firm. For example, the firm\u2019s optimal clearance price can increase with the amount of leftover inventory, and the firm\u2019s optimal after-tax profit can increase as the tax rate increases. While the value of the deduction is tied to the fair market value (and the price) of the product, surprisingly, the firm may find it more profitable to charge a lower price, because the lower price may scale up the demand uncertainty and consequently increase the expected tax subsidy under the enhanced tax deduction.

Logistics service providers as well as local governments are in need of evaluating the potentially substantial impacts of this mode shift, given their economic objectives and environmental concerns. This paper addresses this need by providing new logistics planning models and managerial insights. These models characterize open-loop car routes, car drivers\u2019 wage-response behavior, interplay with the ride-share market, and optimal sizes of service zones within which passenger vehicles pick up goods and fulfill the last-mile delivery. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical estimates in a realistic setting, the findings suggest that crowdsourcing shared mobility is not as scalable as the conventional truck-only system in terms of the operating cost. However, a transition to this paradigm has the potential for creating economic benefits by reducing the truck fleet size and exploiting additional operational flexibilities (e.g., avoiding high-demand areas and peak hours, adjusting vehicle loading capacities, etc.). These insights are insignificantly affected by the dynamic adjustment of wages and prices of the ride-share market. If entering into this paradigm, greenhouse gas emissions may increase because of prolonged car trip distance; on the other hand, even exclusively minimizing operating costs incurs only slightly more emissions than exclusively minimizing emissions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0683","","MSOM","Operations Management","5","['environmental', 'economic benefits', 'greenhouse gas emissions']","The article discusses environmental concerns and the potential economic benefits of shared mobility, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical implications of logistics practices.

Motivated by a subsidy program developed by the Chinese government in 2007, we present a parsimonious model to determine the optimal subsidy program in different settings so as to gain a better understanding about the conditions under which it is optimal for the government to subsidize consumers only, manufacturers only, or both. Our analysis reveals that the structure of the optimal subsidy program depends on (a) whether there is a well-established market selling price for the products; and (b) the relative emphasis that the government places on consumer welfare versus manufacturer profit. Also, we find that governments can improve consumer welfare by developing subsidy programs that involve multiple (competing) manufacturers with different market sizes and adequate capacities.

To create transparency requires a company to both gain visibility into its supply chain and disclose information to consumers. In this paper, we focus on the dimension of visibility and investigate when companies can benefit from greater supply chain visibility. To do so, we design an incentivized human\u2013subject experiment to study two key questions: (i) How does supply chain visibility impact consumers\u2019 valuations of a company\u2019s social responsibility (SR) practices in its upstream supply chain? (ii) What roles do indirect reciprocity and consumers\u2019 prosociality play in affecting their valuations under different levels of visibility? In our design, greater visibility is represented by lower uncertainty in the outcomes of a company\u2019s SR efforts. Our results show that consumers value greater visibility regarding a company\u2019s SR practices in the upstream supply chain. This is especially true if consumers exhibit a self-serving bias and use uncertainty as an excuse not to pay for SR. We also observe that high prosocial consumers do not exhibit strong indirect reciprocity. Conversely, indirect reciprocity significantly increases low prosocial consumers\u2019 valuations under High visibility. Our work adds to the experimental literature focusing on transparency and SR (which has primarily studied disclosure) by examining the equally important but understudied dimension of visibility.

In our experiments, customers are randomly assigned to a treatment condition where virtual fit information is available or to a control condition where virtual fit information is not available.

Although this decision is financially very important, empirical research comparing the two models from an operational perspective has been scarce. These issues are particularly relevant considering that federal and state incentives are commonly used to stimulate adoption. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the role of TPO in the operational performance of nonresidential solar energy installations in California. Using a panel data estimation framework, and accounting for factors that influence TPO adoption, the analysis shows that TPO systems performed, on average, approximately 4% better than DO systems) in terms of their production yield.

This paper studies how customer purchasing behavior and remanufacturing efficiency affect the economic and environmental values of such a business practice. We demonstrate a new benefit of trade-in remanufacturing: it helps exploit the forward-looking behavior of strategic customers, which could be much more significant than the widely recognized revenue-generating and environmental benefits of remanufacturing. High remanufacturing efficiency does not necessarily benefit a firm. With overly high remanufacturing efficiency, product durability is so high that repeat customers are reluctant to trade in and upgrade their used products. When customers are highly strategic, trade-in remanufacturing creates a tension between profitability and sustainability: on one hand, by exploiting the intensive forward-looking customer behavior, trade-in remanufacturing is quite valuable to the firm; on the other hand, with highly strategic customers, trade-in remanufacturing has a substantial negative impact on the environment and social welfare, since it may induce significantly higher production quantities without improving customer surplus. With nearly myopic customers, however, trade-in remanufacturing benefits both the firm and the environment. Therefore, understanding the interactions between customer purchasing behavior and trade-in remanufacturing is important to both firms and policy makers. Finally, to resolve the above tension, we study how a social planner (e.g., government) should design a public policy to maximize social welfare. The social optimum can be achieved by using a simple linear subsidy/tax scheme for both new production and remanufacturing. The proposed policy can also induce the firm to set the socially optimal remanufacturing efficiency.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2017.0696","","MSOM","Operations Management","6","['sustainability', 'social welfare', 'public policy', 'environmental values']","The article discusses the tension between profitability and sustainability, emphasizing the impact of trade-in remanufacturing on social welfare and environmental values.

In congestion-free networks, we show that the perception error model is more general than the existing bounded rationality models with satisficing drivers with special cases when the two approaches yield the same results; that is, satisficing under accurate perception is equivalent to optimizing under inaccurate perception. This motivates us to define generalized bounded rationality in route choice behavior modeling. The proposed modeling framework is general enough to capture link-specific cost-perception of drivers. We use a Monte Carlo method to estimate modeling parameter values to guarantee a certain coverage probability in comparison with the random utility model. We demonstrate how the notion of generalized bounded rationality can be used in robust multicommodity network design problems and devise a cutting plane algorithm.

In the abandonment model, customers take the virtual waiting time distribution as given. Class k customers receive a reward rk from service and incur a cost ck per period of waiting. Customers are forward looking and make wait or abandon decisions dynamically to maximize their expected discounted utilities. The queueing model takes the customers\u2019 abandonment time distribution as an input and studies the resulting virtual waiting time distribution.

Leveraging the so-called state-space collapse property, we provide a characterization of the system performance. Combining the results for the two models, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium in which the customers\u2019 abandonment time and the virtual waiting time for the various classes are consistent in the two models. Finally, we provide a computational scheme to calculate the equilibrium numerically and apply that using data from an Israeli bank call center.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1638","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing systems and customer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2018","66","1","Hyun-Soo Ahn \n                    Corresponding Author\n                Hyun-Soo Ahnhsahn@umich.eduhttp://orcid.org/0000-0002-8103-4477Stephen M.

This is a challenging problem to solve optimally, so we derive a theoretical bound on the performance of a deterministic control (DC) in which all random variables are replaced by their expected values and the corresponding deterministic optimization problem is solved. This is a variant of an approach that is widely used in practice. We show that while DC can perform poorly in some instances, simple reoptimizations of DC (i.e., certainty equivalent control (CEC)) improve the performance of DC. That said, the benefit of reoptimization decreases as the magnitude of demand variation increases. To address this, and also to provide guidance for heuristic design, we derive performance bounds for two additional heuristic controls\u2014(1) open-loop feedback control (OLFC), which reoptimizes a sequence of stochastic programs with a complete demand distribution information, and (2) multipoint approximation control (MPAC), which solves a dynamic program using an approximate demand distribution that incorporates slightly more distributional information beyond simple expected values. We show that although OLFC outperforms CEC, its improvement can be limited. On the other hand, with carefully chosen approximate demand distributions, MPAC can significantly outperform OLFC. This suggests that, in our setting, fully capturing decision dynamics coupled with a small amount of additional distributional information beyond expected values is more useful than fully capturing the demand distribution but coupling that with insufficient modeling of decision dynamics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1647","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization methods for inventory management without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To allow for analytical tractability, the existing literature often assumes almost surely linear supply and demand functions, which greatly limits the applicability of the models. The goal of this paper is to provide a unified approach to analyze general random supply and demand functions. By transforming the problem into one defined on a higher dimension, we show that many of the seemingly highly nonlinear supply and demand functions (in the almost sure sense) are linear in the stochastic sense. With this new notion of linearity, called stochastic linearity in midpoint, our ability to analyze supply chain problems is much enhanced. We are able to prove the concavity of the profit function in the transformed supply and demand decisions for a general class of supply and demand functions that include, but are not restricted to, the ones studied in the existing literature. Thus, many of the challenging problems now become tractable. Moreover, we characterize a set of easy-to-verify conditions for stochastic linearity in midpoint.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1648","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of supply chain management and inventory models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The seller firm under consideration sequentially sells a fixed amount of stock to a random arrival stream of potential buyers who are heterogeneous in product valuation. Based on the stock level and the time to the end of the selling season, the seller may dynamically choose either to post a take-it-or-leave-it price or to engage in bargaining with an arriving buyer. We introduce a stochastic order, called the scaled pricing order, for the buyer\u2019s valuation distribution. The scaled pricing order measures the average portion of trade surplus that the seller can obtain by posting a price. For distributions with increasing length-biased hazard rate, checking the property of increasing (decreasing) scaled pricing order boils down to verifying the concavity (convexity) of the Mills\u2019 ratio. We fully characterize the family of distributions that are invariant in the scaled pricing order, which includes uniform and exponential distributions. When the buyer\u2019s valuation distribution belongs to the invariant family, the seller should stick to either pricing or bargaining throughout the selling season, depending on her bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis the buyer. When the buyer\u2019s valuation is increasing (decreasing) in the scaled pricing order, the seller should choose pricing (bargaining) when she has a small (large) stock to sell over a long (short) horizon. We also discuss several model variations to demonstrate the application of the scaled pricing order in analyzing sequential trading processes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1651","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and bargaining in a selling process without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States requires all blood donations to be tested for certain infection types, it does not dictate which particular tests should be used by blood centers. Multiple FDA-licensed blood screening tests are available for each infection type, and screening tests are imperfectly reliable and have different costs. In addition, infection prevalence rates within the donor population are uncertain for both emerging and established infection types. In this setting, the budget-constrained blood center\u2019s objective is to devise a \u201crobust\u201d postdonation bloodscreening scheme that minimizes the risk of an infectious donation being released into the blood supply. Toward this goal, we study the minimization of the transfusion-transmittable infection risk considering regret- and expectation-based objectives, and we characterize structural properties of their optimal solutions. This allows us to gain insight, derive the price of robustness, and develop efficient algorithms. The proposed robust solution lowers the expected infection risk over various FDA-compliant testing schemes as well as the expectation-based scheme under forecast error.

In this paper, we consider a distributed computing algorithmic scheme for stochastic optimization, which relies on modest communication requirements among processors and most importantly, does not require synchronization. Specifically, we analyze a scheme with N > 1 independent threads each implementing a stochastic gradient algorithm. The threads are coupled via a perturbation of the gradient (with attractive and repulsive forces) in a similar manner to mathematical models of flocking, swarming, and other group formations found in nature with mild communication requirements. When the objective function is convex, we show that a flocking-like approach for distributed stochastic optimization provides a noise reduction effect similar to that of a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of N gradient samples at each step. The distributed nature of flocking makes it an appealing computational alternative. We show that when the overhead related to the time needed to gather N samples and synchronization is not negligible, the flocking implementation outperforms a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of N gradient samples at each step. When the objective function is not convex, the flocking-based approach seems better suited to escape locally optimal solutions due to the repulsive force that enforces a certain level of diversity in the set of candidate solutions. Here again, we show that the noise reduction effect is similar to that associated to the centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of N gradient samples at each step.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1666","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithmic approach to optimization in distributed computing without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Successful treatment of cardiac arrest is extremely time sensitive, and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) where possible significantly increases the probability of survival. Placement of AEDs in public locations can improve survival by enabling bystanders to treat victims of cardiac arrest prior to the arrival of emergency medical responders, thus shortening the time between collapse and treatment. However, since the exact locations of future cardiac arrests cannot be known a priori, AEDs must be placed strategically in public locations to ensure their accessibility in the event of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergency. In this paper, we propose a data-driven optimization model for deploying AEDs in public spaces while accounting for uncertainty in future cardiac arrest locations. Our approach involves discretizing a continuous service area into a large set of scenarios, where the probability of cardiac arrest at each location is itself uncertain. We model uncertainty in the spatial risk of cardiac arrest using a polyhedral uncertainty set that we calibrate using historical cardiac arrest data. We propose a solution technique based on row-and-column generation that exploits the structure of the uncertainty set, allowing the algorithm to scale gracefully with the total number of scenarios. Using real cardiac arrest data from the City of Toronto, we conduct an extensive numerical study on AED deployment public locations. We find that hedging against cardiac arrest location uncertainty can produce AED deployments that outperform an intuitive sample average approximation by 9%\u201315% and cuts the performance gap with respect to an ex post model by half. Our findings suggest that accounting for cardiac arrest location uncertainty can lead to improved accessibility of AEDs during cardiac arrest emergencies and the potential for improved survival outcomes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1660","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['public health', 'accessibility', 'survival outcomes']","The article discusses public health and the accessibility of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), which aligns with themes of social responsibility and improving survival outcomes.

The system queue length is visible so that upon arrival, customers decide to join the system based on the congestion and the price at that time. We analyze this problem in the asymptotic regime of large customer market size and capacity. We find that dynamic pricing performs significantly better than static pricing at mitigating the effect of uncertainty. Asymptotically, the revenue in such systems consists of a positive deterministic component and a negative stochastic component, the latter representing the impact of variability. Static pricing leads to the n1/2-scale effect of variability, i.e., the expected steady-state queue length is Kn1/2 for some K > 0, where n represents the system size. However, dynamic pricing can lower this effect of variability to the n1/3-scale. We further show that a simple policy of using only two prices can achieve most of the benefits of dynamic pricing. We also discuss how our results can apply to other dynamic control problems in queueing systems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1668","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic pricing and revenue maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We analyze a static model, where the ordering rate function must be fully specified at time zero, and three dynamic variants, where re-optimizations are allowed during the planning horizon [0, T] at prespecified review epochs. In the dynamic models, at review epoch \u03c4 \u2208 [0, T], the past demand on [0, \u03c4) is observable. In the first dynamic model, we ignore this information, and define a variant of \u03a9 that is well formed for the remaining planning horizon [\u03c4, T]. In the second model, we define a variant of \u03a9 for [\u03c4, T] that utilizes the past demand information, though we make a simplifying technical assumption about the consistency of the demand on [0, \u03c4) and \u03a9. In the third dynamic model, we remove this assumption, and we remedy the arising complications using the Hilbert Projection Theorem. In all cases we derive optimal closed-form ordering rate functions that equal either the bounds a or b, or weighted averages of these bounds (sb + ha)/(s + h) or (sa + hb)/(s + h), where s and h are the shortage and holding costs, respectively. The strategies differ by when these four ordering rates are applied, which is determined by an uncertainty-set-dependent partition of the remaining planning horizon. Computational experiments, focused on studying the dynamic variants, supplement the analytical results, and demonstrate that (1) the three variants exhibit comparable performance under well-behaved stochastic demand and (2) the third variant has a significant advantage when demand is seasonal, especially when the review frequency is appropriately selected. Finally, computational comparisons with the omniscient strategy q(t) = d(t), for all t \u2208 [0, T], are encouraging.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1669","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and optimization without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

A major stream of the related literature studies optimization problems that feature multivariate stochastic benchmarking constraints. These problems typically involve a univariate stochastic preference relation, often based on stochastic dominance or a coherent risk measure such as conditional value-at-risk, which is then extended to allow the comparison of random vectors by the use of a family of scalarization functions: All scalarized versions of the vector of the uncertain outcomes of a decision are required to be preferable to the corresponding scalarizations of the benchmark outcomes. While this line of research has been dedicated almost entirely to linear scalarizations, the corresponding deterministic literature uses a wide variety of scalarization functions that, among other advantages, offer a high degree of modeling flexibility. In this paper we aim to incorporate these scalarizations into a stochastic context by introducing the general class of min-biaffine functions. We study optimization problems in finite probability spaces with multivariate stochastic benchmarking constraints based on min-biaffine scalarizations. We develop duality results, optimality conditions, and a cut generation method to solve these problems. We also introduce a new characterization of the risk envelope of a coherent risk measure in terms of its Kusuoka representation as a tool toward proving the finite convergence of our solution method. The main computational challenge lies in solving cut generation subproblems; we develop several mixed-integer programming formulations by exploiting the min-affine structure and leveraging recent advances for solving similar problems with linear scalarizations. We conduct a computational study on a well-known homeland security budget allocation problem to examine the impact of the proposed scalarizations on optimal solutions, and illustrate the computational performance of our solution methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1671","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization and decision-making under uncertainty without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The consideration sets of customers of different types are nested in the sense that the consideration set of one customer type is included in the consideration set of another.

Each product, if offered to customers, occupies a certain amount of space. The sale of each product generates a certain amount of revenue. Given that customers choose from among the offered products according to the multinomial logit model with nested consideration sets, the goal of the assortment problem is to find a set of products to offer to maximize the expected revenue obtained from a customer, while making sure that the total space consumption of the offered products does not exceed a certain limit.

The effectiveness of the method is especially noticeable when these parameters are only known to lie inside some uncertainty region. Unfortunately, there are important computational considerations that have prevented the methodology from being fully adopted in fields of practice where the cost function that needs to be robustified is nonlinear with respect to such parameters. In this paper, we propose a new robust optimization formulation that circumvent the computational burden in problems where the cost decomposes as the sum of costs that each involve a single decision variable. This is done by exploiting the fact that in this formulation the worst-case cost function can be expressed as a convex combination between a nominal and an upper-bounding cost function. One can still control the conservatism of the robust solution by adjusting how many terms of this total cost can simultaneously reach their respective most pessimistic value. To demonstrate the potential of this \u201cpracticable robust counterpart\u201d formulation, we present how it can be employed for the robust optimization of packet routing on a telecommunication network with congestion. In such problems, an important source of uncertainty stems from the queueing delay, which is usually approximated by a nonlinear convex function using the theory of M/M/1 queues. Computational results on a large number of problem instances of realistic size confirm that it is possible to identify robust solutions that significantly outperform a deterministic approach in terms of both the amount of congestion and the risks of excessive congestion. Moreover, our proposed method also improves significantly the quality of solutions that are obtained using two other natural approximation schemes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1679","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization methods without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The latencies of edges are composed of free-flow transit times and possible queuing time due to capacity constraints. We give a precise description of the dynamics induced by the individual strategies of players and of the corresponding costs, either when the traffic is controlled by a planner, or when players act selfishly. In parallel networks, optimal and equilibrium behavior eventually coincide, but the selfish behavior of the initial players has consequences that cannot be undone and are paid by all future generations. In more general topologies, our main contributions are threefold. First, we illustrate a new dynamic version of Braess paradox: the presence of initial queues in the network may decrease the long-run costs in equilibrium. This paradox can arise in networks for which no Braess paradox was previously known. Second, we show that equilibria are not unique and can induce very different long-run costs. In particular, we give a sequence of networks such that the price of stability is equal to 1, and the price of anarchy is equal to n \u2212 1, where n is the number of vertices. Third, we propose an extension to model seasonalities by assuming that departure flows fluctuate periodically over time. We introduce a measure that captures the queues induced by periodicity of inflows. For optimal and equilibrium flows in parallel networks this measure is the increase in cost compared to uniform departures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1683","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of congestion games and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper analyzes, given the sequential nature of reviews and the limited feedback of such past reviews, the information content they communicate to future customers. We consider a model with heterogeneous customers who buy a product of unknown quality and we focus on two different informational settings. In the first setting, customers observe the whole history of past reviews. In the second one they only observe the sample mean of past reviews. We examine under which conditions, in each setting, customers can recover the true quality of the product based on the feedback they observe. In the case of total monitoring, if consumers adopt a fully rational Bayesian updating paradigm, then they asymptotically learn the unknown quality. With access to only the sample mean of past reviews, inference becomes intricate for customers and it is not clear if, when, and how social learning can take place. We first analyze the setting when customers interpret the mean as the proxy of quality. We show that in the long run, the sample mean of reviews stabilizes and, in general, customers overestimate the underlying quality of the product. We establish properties of the bias, stemming from the selection associated with observing only reviews of customers who purchase. Then, we show the existence of a simple non-Bayesian quality inference rule that leads to social learning when all customers use such a rule. The results point to the strong information content of even limited statistics of past reviews as long as customers have minimal sophistication.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1676","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical analysis of consumer reviews and ratings without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When Markov chains are used as a modeling framework for such studies, this data inadequacy can manifest itself as imprecision in the elements of the transition matrix. In this paper, we study how to compute maximal and minimal values for the discounted value of the chain (with respect to a vector of state-wise costs or rewards) as these uncertain transition parameters jointly vary within a given uncertainty set. We show that these problems are computationally tractable if the uncertainty set has a row-wise structure. Conversely, we prove that the row-wise structure is necessary for tractability. Without it, the problems become computationally intractable (strongly NP-hard).

It is a crucial element in port planning to achieve quick turnaround time for vessels. To solve this problem, many solution methods have been developed in the literature. However, gaps between the best-known lower and upper bounds on its optimal solutions are far from close. In this paper, we propose new and more effective solution methods for this important problem. By introducing a novel relaxation of the problem, we have derived a new lower bound that can be computed efficiently in quadratic time. By incorporating this new lower bound with some new heuristic and pruning techniques, we have developed a new exact method, based on a branch-and-bound approach. To demonstrate general applicability of the proposed methods, we have extended them to a more complicated problem, where decisions on berth allocations are restricted by a quay crane constraint. Extensive computational results have shown that, compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our new methods have significantly reduced gaps between the lower and upper bounds and have solved more and larger instances to optimality in significantly less time.

Whereas the past literature used the variance as the dispersion measure, here we use the mean absolute deviation from the mean (MAD). This makes it possible to use the 1972 result of Ben-Tal and Hochman (BH) in which tight upper and lower bounds on the expectation of a convex function of a random variable are given. First, we use these results to treat ambiguous expected feasibility constraints to obtain exact reformulations for both functions that are convex and concave in the components of the random variable. This approach requires, however, the independence of the random variables and, moreover, may lead to an exponential number of terms in the resulting robust counterparts. We then show how upper bounds can be constructed that alleviate the independence restriction, and require only a linear number of terms, by exploiting models in which random variables are linearly aggregated. Moreover, using the BH bounds we derive three new safe tractable approximations of chance constraints of increasing computational complexity and quality. In a numerical study, we demonstrate the efficiency of our methods in solving stochastic optimization problems under mean-MAD ambiguity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1688","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization under stochastic constraints without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Res. 62(3):524\u2013534.]use an infinitely repeated game with discounting, among a set of homogeneous players, to model a scrip system. In each period, a randomly chosen player requests service; all the other players have a choice of whether or not to volunteer to provide service. Among the players who volunteer, the service provider is chosen using the minimum-scrip rule: a player with the minimum number of scrips is chosen as the service provider. The authors study the always-trade strategy for a player, that is, the strategy of a player always willing to provide service, regardless of the distribution of scrips among the players. A key result of their work is that, under the minimum-scrip rule, for any number of players and for every discount factor close enough to one, there exists a Nash equilibrium in which each player plays the always-trade strategy. This result, however, is established under an assumption of severe punishment: If a player selected to provide service refuses to do so even once, then that player will be forever banned from participating in the system, thus losing all potential future benefit. Johnson et al. (2014) explain that this assumption is unsatisfactory, particularly for large scrip systems, because of difficulties in detecting players who refuse to provide service and verifying the reason(s) for their refusal, and the consequent possibility of players being unfairly banned. Motivated by this concern, the authors suggest an important direction of future research: investigate whether or not the always-trade strategy is an equilibrium without the punishment assumption.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1689","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['unfairly banned', 'service', 'punishment']","The article discusses the potential unfair banning of players in a service system, which touches on themes of fairness and equity, but the primary focus remains on technical modeling rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

The value generated from a match between a pair of agents is the sum of the two productivity terms, each of which depends only on the type (but not the identity) of one of the agents, and a third deterministic term driven by the pair of types. We prove, under reasonable assumptions, that when the number of agent types is kept fixed, the relative size of the core vanishes rapidly as the number of agents grows.

Using a Markov decision process formulation, we develop two heuristic policies that use limited information such as mean travel times and congestion levels to determine (a) how to allocate ambulances to patient locations and (b) which medical facility should be the destination for those ambulances. In a simulation study, we incorporate patient survival rates and service times for different types of traumatic injuries, and show that the proposed heuristics can provide substantial improvement in the expected number of survivors compared to the common practice of transporting to the nearest facility, even when the decision maker has only limited up-to-date information about the system state. In particular, a myopic approach that considers only what is best for the next patient to be transported increases the expected number of survivors in almost all scenarios considered. Using a more sophisticated one-step policy improvement approach provides further improvement when the event involves patients who do not deteriorate rapidly, especially when the transportation is not the bottleneck and the casualties are spread over many locations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics on a case study of a hypothetical earthquake, where casualty data is generated using computer software developed by the U.S. government.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1695","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['disaster', 'patients', 'survivors', 'emergency responders']","The article discusses the allocation of resources in disaster scenarios, which touches on ethical decision-making and the importance of patient survival.

In this paper, we consider an online display advertising setting in which a web publisher posts display ads on its website and charges based on the cost-per-impression (CPM) pricing scheme while promising to deliver a certain number of impressions on the ads posted. The publisher faces uncertain demand for advertising slots and uncertain supply of visits from viewers. We formulate the problem as a queueing system, where the advertising slots correspond to service channels with the service rate of each server synchronized with other active servers. We determine the publisher\u2019s optimal price to charge per impression and show that it can increase in the number of impressions made of each ad, which is in contrast to the quantity discount commonly offered in practice. We show that the optimal CPM price may increase in the number of ads rotating among slots. This result is typically not expected because an increase in the number of rotating ads in the system can be interpreted as an increase in the service capacity. However, the capacity increase leads to an increase in the fill rate of the demand (the portion of demand satisfied by the publisher). Hence, the publisher can afford to optimally decrease the arrival rate by increasing the price.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1697","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical analysis of pricing strategies in display advertising without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper we show that two-stage robust and distributionally robust linear programs can often be reformulated exactly as conic programs that scale polynomially with the problem dimensions. Specifically, when the ambiguity set constitutes a 2-Wasserstein ball centered at a discrete distribution, the distributionally robust linear program is equivalent to a copositive program (if the problem has complete recourse) or can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a sequence of copositive programs (if the problem has sufficiently expensive recourse). These results directly extend to the classical robust setting and motivate strong tractable approximations of two-stage problems based on semidefinite approximations of the copositive cone. We also demonstrate that the two-stage distributionally robust optimization problem is equivalent to a tractable linear program when the ambiguity set constitutes a 1-Wasserstein ball centered at a discrete distribution and there are no support constraints.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1698","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization problems without any mention of socially progressive themes, such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

That is, customers compare these two attributes with their rational expectations of outcomes, with losses being more painful than equal-sized gains are pleasant. We first study customers\u2019 equilibrium queueing strategies. We find that, unlike the traditional case in which loss aversion is not considered, there may exist three equilibrium strategies, one of which is preferred in the sense that customers\u2019 utility is highest at this equilibrium. We then investigate the optimal pricing problem for a monopoly server and find that loss aversion polarizes queues, making long queues even longer and short queues even shorter. Furthermore, loss aversion toward the delay attribute drives the optimal price down, whereas loss aversion toward the price attribute drives it up. We also find that profit- and welfare-maximizing prices are not the same in a monopoly market. Finally, we consider pricing competition in a symmetric duopoly market and find that the conclusions depend on the size of the service capacity relative to the market size. For fast servers, there exists a unique symmetric price equilibrium. Under certain conditions, the effect of loss aversion on waiting time drives the price down, whereas that on the monetary term drives it up. For moderate-speed servers, there also exists a unique symmetric equilibrium. However, the effect of loss aversion on the two attributes works in reverse compared with that in the fast server case. For slow servers, we show that a symmetric equilibrium may not exist, and we numerically find that there may exist two asymmetric equilibria. Interestingly, with loss-averse customers, a firm can obtain a higher profit in a duopoly market than in a monopoly market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1702","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service pricing and customer behavior without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

We first provide a formulation for inverse optimization and prove it to be NP-hard. In contrast to existing methods, we show that the parameter estimates produced by our formulation are statistically consistent. Our approach involves combining a new duality-based reformulation for bilevel programs with a regularization scheme that smooths discontinuities in the formulation. Using epi-convergence theory, we show the regularization parameter can be adjusted to approximate the original inverse optimization problem to arbitrary accuracy, which we use to prove our consistency results. Next, we propose two solution algorithms based on our duality-based formulation. The first is an enumeration algorithm that is applicable to settings where the dimensionality of the parameter space is modest, and the second is a semiparametric approach that combines nonparametric statistics with a modified version of our formulation. These numerical algorithms are shown to maintain the statistical consistency of the underlying formulation. Finally, using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively when compared with existing heuristics.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1705","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inverse optimization and does not address any social, ethical, or progressive themes.

Most HCC cases are attributed to chronic hepatitis C virus infection, which affects nearly 3 million Americans and 100 million people globally. Although surveillance for HCC in hepatitis C patients can improve survival, the optimal surveillance policies remain unknown. In this study, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP)-based framework to systematically analyze a rich set of policies and determine the optimal HCC surveillance policies that maximize societal net benefit. Our MIP-based framework addresses two problem features that make dynamic programming-based formulation computationally intractable. In particular, our proposed framework allows the formulation of (1) M-switch policies that are practical for implementation and (2) tailored surveillance policies with screening intervals stratified by the precursor disease states. We theoretically analyze the HCC surveillance problem, characterize when the surveillance policies should be adapted to populations with different disease progression rates, and quantify the trade-off between decreasing HCC incidence and increasing treatment outcomes. We parameterize our model using clinical trial data, a previously validated simulation model, and published clinical studies. Our numerical analyses lead to three main results with important policy implications. First, we find that, in addition to cirrhotic patients, expanding surveillance to patients in the earlier stages of hepatitis C infection improves the cost-effectiveness of HCC surveillance. Second, compared with the \u201cone size fits all\u201d routine policies, we find that it is cost-effective to stratify surveillance strategies based on the stage of hepatitis C infection with less frequent cancer surveillance in the earlier stages of infection. Finally, we find that a little flexibility in the policy structure as captured by M-switch policies is sufficient to capture almost as much benefit as from complex fully dynamic policies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1706","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['societal net benefit', 'cost-effectiveness', 'surveillance policies']","The article discusses surveillance policies that aim to maximize societal net benefit and improve health outcomes for hepatitis C patients, indicating a moderate focus on societal impact.

We focus on the two-player case and study conditions that guarantee the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for progressively more complicated classes of networks. For general graphs, we show that attention can be restricted to a subset of vertices referred to as the central block. By constructing trees of maximal bi-connected components, we obtain sufficient conditions for equilibrium existence. Moreover, when the central block is a vertex or a cycle (for example, in cactus graphs), this provides a complete and efficient characterization of equilibria. In that case, we show that both competitors locate their facilities in a solution to the 1-median problem, generalizing a well-known insight arising from Hotelling\u2019s model. We further show that an equilibrium must solve the 1-median problem in other classes of graphs, including grids, which essentially capture the topology of urban networks.

We provide a characterization of the conditions under which upstream suppliers adopt sourcing strategies that are suboptimal from the perspective of firms further downstream. Our analysis highlights that a focus on optimizing procurement decisions in each tier of the supply chain in isolation may not be sufficient for mitigating risks at an aggregate level. Rather, we argue that a holistic view of the entire supply network is necessary to properly assess and secure against disruptive events. Importantly, the misalignment we identify does not originate from cost or reliability asymmetries.

A control policy specifies when a batch of components should be produced and whether an arriving demand for each product should be satisfied. As optimal solutions for our model are computationally intractable for even moderately sized systems, we approximate the optimal cost function by reformulating it on an aggregate state space and restricting each aggregate state to be represented by its extreme original states. Our aggregation drastically reduces the value iteration computational burden. We derive an upper bound on the distance between aggregate and optimal solutions. This guarantees that the value iteration algorithm for the original problem initialized with the aggregate solution converges to the optimal solution. We also establish the optimality of a lattice-dependent base-stock and rationing policy in the aggregate problem when certain product and component characteristics are incorporated into the aggregation/disaggregation schemes. This enables us to further alleviate the value iteration computational burden in the aggregate problem by eliminating suboptimal actions. Leveraging all of our results, we can solve the aggregate problem for systems of up to 22 components, with an average distance of 11.09% from the optimal cost in systems of up to 4 components (for which we could solve the original problem to optimality).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1710","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical method for optimizing assemble-to-order systems without any mention of socially progressive themes, such as diversity, ethics, or sustainability.

After defining the notion of an information-constrained wardrop equilibrium (ICWE) for this class of congestion games and studying its basic properties, we turn to our main focus: whether additional information can be harmful (in the sense of generating greater equilibrium costs/delays). We formulate this question in the form of an informational Braess\u2019 paradox (IBP), which extends the classic Braess\u2019 paradox in traffic equilibria and asks whether users receiving additional information can become worse off. We provide a comprehensive answer to this question showing that in any network in the series of linearly independent (SLI) class, which is a strict subset of series-parallel networks, the IBP cannot occur, and in any network that is not in the SLI class, there exists a configuration of edge-specific cost functions for which the IBP will occur. In the process, we establish several properties of the SLI class of networks, which include the characterization of the complement of the SLI class in terms of embedding a specific set of networks, and also an algorithm that determines whether a graph is SLI in linear time.

The stationary distributions of the approximations are used as proxies for those of the queues. The convergence of suitably scaled and centered processes provides mathematical support for the use of these Brownian models. As with the central limit theorem, to establish convergence, one must impose assumptions directly on the primitives or indirectly on the parameters of a related optimization problem. These assumptions reflect an interpretation of the underlying parameters\u2014a classification into so-called heavy-traffic regimes that specify a scaling relationship between the utilization and the arrival rate. Here, it matters whether a utilization of 90% in a queue with an arrival rate of \u03bb = 100 is read as \ud835\udf0c\u2061(\ud835\udf06)=0.9=1\u22121/\u221a\ud835\udf06\u03c1\u2061(\u03bb)=0.9=1\u22121/\u03bb or as \u03c1(\u03bb) \u2261 0.9, because different interpretations lead to different limits and, in turn, to different approximations. However, from a heuristic point of view, there is an immediate Brownian (i.e., normal) analogue of the queueing model that is derived directly from the primitives and requires no scaling interpretation of the parameters. In this model, the drift is that of the original queue, and the noise term is replaced by a Brownian motion with the same variance. This is intuitive and appealing as a tool, but it lacks mathematical justification. In this paper, we prove that for the fundamental M/GI/1 + GI queue, this direct intuitive approach works: the Brownian model is accurate uniformly over a family of patience distributions and universally in the heavy-traffic regime. The validity of this approach extends to dynamic control in that the solution of the directly derived diffusion control problem is universally accurate. To build mathematical support for the accuracy of this model, we introduce a framework built around \u201cqueue families\u201d that allows us to treat various patience distributions simultaneously, and it uncovers the role of a concentration property of the queue.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2017.1715","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing theory and performance analysis without any reference to social themes, ethics, or diversity.

Then, the Pareto-optimal risk sharing problem is solved through explicit construction. To study risk sharing in a competitive market, an Arrow\u2013Debreu equilibrium is established for some simple yet natural settings.

The benefit of random walks is that they preserve the probabilistic structure of residual graphs, greatly facilitating analysis. Our approach allows us to analytically show the benefit of chains, as opposed to transplantation in cycles only, in nonasymptotic (medium-sized) graphs. We also derive useful analytical bounds that illustrate the performance of our proposed allocation procedure and more general kidney allocation procedures. Our results complement previous findings from analytical results in large (limit) graphs and empirical results based on data from fielded kidney exchanges demonstrating the benefits of chains. Moreover, our analysis sheds light on the relative importance of chains versus cycles in kidney allocation. In particular, our results show prioritizing chains over easy-to-transplant cycles, as opposed to prioritizing those cycles over chains, improves performance and provides analytical bounds on the associated benefits.

We know of no positive monotonicity results in the setting where the first-order approach does not apply. Indeed, it is well documented that when there are finitely many possible outputs, and the first-order approach does not apply, the MLRP alone is insufficient to guarantee monotonicity. However, we show that when there is an interval of possible output signals, the MLRP does suffice to establish monotonicity under additional technical assumptions that do not guarantee the validity of the first-order approach. To establish this result we examine necessary optimality conditions for moral hazard problems using a novel penalty function approach.

By studying function \u03c9(z), we identify certain properties of the trade-off. To implement the new instrument, we design two algorithms to construct function \u03c9(z) and its approximation. Both algorithms rely on solving the value of \u03c9(z) for any given z, for which we propose two effective solution approaches. We apply the new instrument to a class of machine scheduling games, showing its wide applicability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1723","","OR","Multidisciplinary","3","['cooperation', 'penalization', 'subsidization']","The article discusses mechanisms for promoting cooperation, which hints at social responsibility, but lacks a strong focus on social justice or critical theory.

In contrast to the classical perishable inventory literature, we assume that the firm does not know the demand distribution a priori and makes replenishment decisions in each period based only on the past sales (censored demand) data. It is well known that even with complete information about the demand distribution a priori, the optimal policy for this problem does not possess a simple structure. Motivated by the studies in the literature showing that base-stock policies perform near optimal in these systems, we focus on finding the best base-stock policy. We first establish a convexity result, showing that the total holding, lost sales and outdating cost is convex in the base-stock level. Then, we develop a nonparametric learning algorithm that generates a sequence of order-up-to levels whose running average cost converges to the cost of the optimal base-stock policy. We establish a square-root convergence rate of the proposed algorithm, which is the best possible.

We formulate RTSP from the perspective of distributional robustness by hedging against the worst-case distribution within an ambiguity set and considering the corresponding expected total cost. In particular, we derive an equivalent reformulation for RTSP that indicates that each worst-case expectation over an L1-norm-based ambiguity set reduces to a convex combination of a conditional value-at-risk and an essential supremum. Our reformulation explicitly shows how additional data can help reduce the conservatism of the problem from the traditional two-stage robust optimization to the traditional risk-neutral two-stage stochastic program (TSP).Accordingly, we develop solution algorithms for the reformulations of RTSP based on the sample average approximation method. We also extend the studies to ambiguity sets based on L\u221e-norm, joint L1- and L\u221e-norm, and joint L1-norm and the first two moments, respectively. Furthermore, starting from a set of historical data samples, we utilize nonparametric statistics to construct these ambiguity sets.We perform convergence analysis to show that the ambiguity-aversion of RTSP vanishes as the data size increases to infinity, in the sense that the optimal objective value and the set of optimal solutions of RTSP converge to those of risk-neutral TSP.Finally, numerical experiments on newsvendor and lot-sizing problems explain and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1729","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic programming and distributional ambiguity without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

For any constant k, when m = O(n1+1/[2k(k+3)]), RandGraph generates an asymptotically uniform random graph with n vertices, m edges, and no cycle of length at most k using O(n2m) operations. We also characterize the approximation error for finite values of n. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. RandGraph works by sequentially adding m edges to an empty graph with n vertices. Recently, such sequential algorithms have been successful for random sampling problems.

Furthermore, the influx of renewable power, wind, and solar, in particular, has made these density shapes very weather dependent.

Using a Cox regression analysis, we show that callers\u2019 abandonment behavior may differ based on their contact history, and changes across their different contacts. We control for caller heterogeneity using a two-step grouped-fixed effect method. This analysis shows that differences in callers\u2019 abandonment behavior are not only driven by their heterogeneity but also by differences in their beliefs about their delays affected by their contact history. As a result, callers\u2019 beliefs about the waiting time distribution may not match the actual distribution in the call center, and the equilibrium condition in the rational expectation equilibrium assumption may not hold. To understand callers\u2019 prior belief about the waiting time distribution, and to disentangle the impact of changes in their beliefs driven by their contact history from the impact of their intrinsic parameters, we use a structural estimation approach in a Bayesian learning framework. We estimate the parameters of this model from a call center data set with multiple priority classes. We show that in this call center, new callers who do not have any prior experience with the call center are optimistic about their delay in the system and underestimate its length irrespective of their priority classes. We also show that our Bayesian learning model not only has a better fit to the data set compared to the rational expectation equilibrium model but also outperforms the rational expectation equilibrium model in out-of-sample tests. Our Bayesian framework not only sheds light on callers\u2019 learning process and their beliefs about their delays, but also could leverage callers\u2019 contact history to provide personalized patience level for callers.

They are practical alternatives to complex nonlinear tariffs in on-demand services and technology industries and are more profitable than the restrictive per-unit and unlimited-use pricing. A 2PT imposes both a fixed (access) fee and a per-unit (usage) fee, and a 3PT generalizes it by bundling some free units (an allowance) into the fixed fee. Intuitively, bundling free allowance provides an additional lever to the firm, enabling it to charge differential marginal rates to improve profitability. However, designing a 3PT is a challenging problem, and the optimal solution is known only when the market has homogeneous consumers or two discrete segments. We advance theory about optimal 3PT design by developing a reformulation that simplifies the solution procedure for the general case and generates new theoretical and practical insights. Our analysis reveals, surprisingly, that when the market demand follows an increasing price elasticity (or, approximately, when consumer distribution follows an increasing hazard rate), the optimal 3PT outcomes are identical to optimal 2PT outcomes. This result generalizes to a menu of tariffs. By contrast, the free allowance in a 3PT may be truly impactful when market demand is multimodal or corresponds to distinct segments with sharp across-segment differences, or when consumers have certain tariff biases. Our results help explain how and when 3PT matters, and they can help managers make informed decisions about how to design and employ nonlinear pricing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1745","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of tariff design and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This constraint allows us to circumvent common overestimation that arises when other procedures are used, such as fixing the center of mass and the covariance matrix of the distribution.

Our model allows for \u201cunrelated\u201d machines: the distributions of processing times may vary across both jobs and machines. We study static routing policies, which assign (or \u201croute\u201d) each job to a particular machine at the start of the problem and then sequence jobs on each machine according to the weighted shortest expected processing time rule. We discuss how to obtain a good routing of jobs to machines by solving a convex quadratic optimization problem that has \ud835\udc3d\u00d7\ud835\udc40J\u00d7M variables and depends only on the job processing distributions through their expected values. Our main result is an additive performance bound on the suboptimality of this static routing policy relative to an optimal adaptive, nonanticipative scheduling policy. This result implies that such static routing policies are asymptotically optimal as the number of jobs grows large. In the special case of \u201cuniformly related\u201d machines\u2014that is, machines differing only in their speeds\u2014we obtain a similar but slightly sharper result for a static routing policy that routes jobs to machines proportionally to machine speeds. We also study the impact that dependence in processing times across jobs can have on the suboptimality of the static routing policy. The main novelty in our work is deriving lower bounds on the performance of an optimal adaptive, nonanticipative scheduling policy; we do this through the use of an information relaxation in which all processing times are revealed before scheduling jobs and a penalty that appropriately compensates for this additional information.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1749","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of scheduling and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such deviations are bounded by a given tolerance. We first propose a bilevel program that, in contrast to previous studies, does not require a priori route generation. We then transform this bilevel model into a single-stage equivalent model using duality theory to yield a compact formulation. We finally reformulate the problem by describing the extreme rays of the polyhedral cone of the compact formulation and by projecting out the auxiliary variables, which leads to facet-defining inequalities and a cut formulation with an exponential number of constraints. We develop a branch-and-cut algorithm for the resulting model, as well as two separation algorithms to solve the cut formulation. Through extensive experiments on real and randomly generated networks, we demonstrate that our best model and algorithm accelerate the solution process by at least two orders of magnitude compared with the best published algorithm. Furthermore, our best model significantly increases the size of the instances that can be solved optimally.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1756","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical problem related to law enforcement and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By combining path planning with network optimization, our approach allows the user to control and optimize the geometric characteristics of wildlife corridors. We illustrate our approach on two realistic landscapes and present numerical results on several computer-generated landscapes.

This challenge is magnified by the presence of random error whereby an adaptive algorithm searching for better designs can at times mistakenly accept an inferior design. In contrast to performing multiple simulations at a design point to estimate the performance of the design, we propose a framework for adaptive search algorithms that executes a single simulation for each design point encountered. Here the estimation errors are reduced by averaging the performances from previously evaluated designs drawn from a shrinking ball around the current design point. We show under mild regularity conditions for continuous design spaces that the accumulated errors, although dependent, form a martingale process, and hence, by the strong law of large numbers for martingales, the average errors converge to zero as the algorithm proceeds. This class of algorithms is shown to converge to a global optimum with probability one. By employing a shrinking ball approach with single observations, an adaptive search algorithm can simultaneously improve the estimates of performance while exploring new and potentially better design points. Numerical experiments offer empirical support for this paradigm of single observation simulation optimization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1759","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization methods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus reflecting a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2018","66","6","Tobias Hellmann\n                    Corresponding Author\n                Tobias HellmannNorddeutsche Landesbank, Hannover 30159, Germany;Search for more papers by this author, Jacco J.

Ambiguity in a Real Options Game","In this paper, we study an investment game between two firms with a first-mover advantage, where payoffs are driven by a geometric Brownian motion. At least one of the firms is assumed to be ambiguous over the drift, with maxmin preferences over a strongly rectangular set of priors. We develop a strategy and equilibrium concept allowing for ambiguity and show that equilibria can be preemptive (a firm invests at a point where investment is Pareto dominated by waiting) or sequential (one firm invests as if it were the exogenously appointed leader). Following the standard literature, the worst-case prior for an ambiguous firm in the follower role is obtained by setting the lowest possible trend in the set of priors. However, if an ambiguous firm is the first mover, then the worst-case drift can fluctuate between the lowest and the highest trends. This novel result shows that \u201cworst-case prior\u201d in a setting with drift ambiguity does not always equate to \u201clowest trend.\u201d As a consequence, preemptive pressure reduces. We show that this results in a possibly increasing level of ambiguity in firm value.

The recent connections between RO and problems in statistics and machine learning domains demand for solving RO problems in ever larger scales. However, the traditional approaches for solving RO formulations based on building and solving robust counterparts or the iterative approaches utilizing nominal feasibility oracles can be prohibitively expensive and thus significantly hinder the scalability of the RO paradigm. In this paper, we present a general and flexible iterative framework to approximately solve robust convex optimization problems that is built on a fully online first-order paradigm. In comparison with the existing literature, a key distinguishing feature of our approach is that it requires access to only first-order oracles that are remarkably cheaper than pessimization or nominal feasibility oracles, while maintaining the same convergence rates. This, in particular, makes our approach much more scalable and hence preferable in large-scale applications, specifically those from machine learning and statistics domains. We also provide new interpretations of existing iterative approaches in our framework and illustrate our framework on robust quadratic programming.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2018.1764","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of robust optimization without any mention of social themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

However, organizations are also political coalitions that face internal contestation over strategies, policies, and goals. The decision of whether to collect information impacts both the goals that organization members try to meet and the organization\u2019s capacity to meet them. This paper develops a formal model that introduces political conflict into a theory of organizational learning. The model has a key insight: organizations characterized by political conflict will forego learning when leaders do not need to learn to build consensus in support of change, and will learn when leaders are unable to build such a consensus without learning. As a result, political conflict leads organizations to implement changes without first learning and to frequently learn when no changes are forthcoming. These tendencies toward ignorant decision making and educated inertia will be more pronounced when environmental variability is high, when learning about existing policies does not also teach about potential policy alternatives, and when organization members are risk averse. The model offers predictions about pathological learning behaviors that are consistent with considerable prior qualitative research. These patterns cannot be produced by experiential learning models in which political conflict is not present.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1164","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['political conflict', 'organizational learning', 'decision making']","The article discusses political conflict within organizations and its impact on decision-making processes, which touches on themes of power dynamics and governance.

Increasingly, firms also partner across institutional boundaries (countries, industries, technologies) in their search for new knowledge. When both structural and institutional separation affect knowledge recombination, aggregate characterizations of ego network attributes mask distinct recombination processes that lead to distinct types of innovation outcomes. We address this issue by focusing on triads as the locus of recombination in networks. We partition firms\u2019 networks into three configurations of open triads\u2014foreign, domestic, and mixed\u2014based on the distribution of the broker and its partners across or within institutional boundaries. We argue that each configuration embodies distinct recombination processes, with foreign triads offering high access to novel knowledge, domestic triads facilitating relatively efficient knowledge integration, and mixed triads balancing the two. We apply this approach to a global research and development alliance network in the biotechnology industry, using countries as institutional boundaries. The results show that domestic triads affect innovation volume (i.e., the productivity of innovation) more strongly than mixed or foreign triads. In contrast, foreign triads have a greater impact on innovation radicalness (i.e., the path-breaking nature of the innovation) than mixed or domestic triads. The findings suggest that different brokerage configurations embody unique recombination processes, leading to distinct innovation outcomes.

Using data on the evolving cannabis markets in the states of Colorado and Washington during the year following the initial emergence of the recreational category, we find a sharpening of identity among medical dispensaries in communities with low voter support for recreational-use legalization. Medical dispensaries accentuated the medical orientation of their identities as recreational dispensaries increasingly set up operations and as buyers inclined more toward recreational use. In contrast, we find a blurring of medical/recreational identity in communities where voters demonstrated support for recreational-use legalization in the state-level ballot.

Whereas past research has mostly established that dispersed wages increase interfirm mobility, we investigate the conditions under which pay variance might have the opposite effect, serving to retain workers. We propose that the effect of wage dispersion is contingent on organizational rank and that it depends on whether wages are dispersed vertically (between job levels) or horizontally (within the same job level). We find that vertical wage dispersion suppresses cross-firm mobility because it is associated with outcomes beneficial for employees, such as attractive advancement opportunities. By contrast, horizontal wage dispersion increases cross-firm mobility because it is associated with outcomes harmful for employees, such as inequity concerns. We further find that the vertical-dispersion effect is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) different-level wage earners because bottom (top) wage earners have the most (least) to gain from climbing the job ladder. Similarly, the horizontal-dispersion effect is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) same-level wage earners because bottom (top) wage earners are most (least) subject to negative consequences of this dispersion.

Past scholarship has largely explained this growth as the result of traditional managerial demands for added control over workers, coupled with newly available cheap technology (such as closed-circuit televisions and body-worn cameras). We draw on the workplace resistance literature to complement these views by suggesting that workers can also drive such growth. More specifically, we show that workers under surveillance can feel constantly observed and seen, but they can also feel largely unnoticed as individuals by management. This paradoxical experience leads them to interpret the surveillance as coercive and to engage in invisibility practices to attempt to go unseen and remain unnoticed. Management, in turn, interprets these attempts as justification for more surveillance, which encourages workers to engage in even more invisibility practices, thus creating a self-fulfilling cycle of coercive surveillance. Our study therefore offers one of the first endogenous explanations for the growth of surveillance while also isolating unique forms of resistance attached to such surveillance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1175","","OS","Management & Organizations","7","['surveillance', 'workers', 'invisibility', 'resistance', 'coercive']","The article discusses the coercive nature of surveillance in the workplace and highlights the resistance of workers, which aligns with themes of social justice and ethical critiques of managerial practices.

We describe two mechanisms through which communication networks affect group performance: (1) the number of direct communication paths and (2) the clarity of the coordination logic. These mechanisms map onto two network dimensions: density, which affects a group\u2019s behavior through the number of available communication paths, and centralization, which affects a group\u2019s behavior through the clarity of the coordination logic. We empirically analyze the effects of turnover on the performance of fully connected all-channel networks and hub-and-spoke or wheel networks in an experiment of 109 four-person groups performing two collaborative problem-solving tasks. The greater number of direct communication paths enabled fully connected groups with stable membership to develop stronger transactive memory systems (TMSs) and perform better than fully connected groups that experienced turnover. By contrast, the clear coordination logic of perfectly centralized groups that experienced turnover facilitated more frequent dyadic communication, which enabled them to strengthen their TMSs, incorporate the contributions of new members, and improve their performance. Thus, our results indicate that communication networks condition the effect of membership turnover on group processes and performance.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1176","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['communication', 'group performance', 'turnover']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of communication networks and group performance, with no explicit mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, analyses of nearly decomposable systems have tended to be at a single level of analysis and have generally neglected the vertical element of nearly decomposable systems. Critical to the notion of nearly decomposable systems is the property that the details of a particular subproblem may be encapsulated and captured by more aggregate parameters and that those subproblems interact in an aggregate way. We explore these issues in reference to the role of three canonical organizational structures in facilitating adaptation in the presence of near decomposability: a traditional hierarchy in which a subordinate reports to a single boss, an autonomous form in which the subordinate does not have a direct reporting relationship, and a multiauthority structure in which the subordinate reports to multiple bosses. Despite the ubiquity and potential benefits of multiauthority structures in coordinating highly interdependent tasks, our understanding of the mechanisms that determine the performance of those structures is still relatively modest. Scholars have noted conflicting empirical findings and have called for a more rigorous approach to study these organizational forms. To help address these issues, we develop an agent-based computational model that compares the performance of these three canonical types of organizational forms in settings characterized by different degrees of complexity and near decomposability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1177","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational structures', 'adaptation', 'hierarchy']","The article primarily focuses on organizational structures and performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We provide qualitative evidence that shows how firms select a sample of adverse events and then engage in inferential learning. We show that firms use the reports of others to extract new valid knowledge from the adverse events in other firms. We use quantitative evidence to explore how a public repository can be used to provide more direct evidence of vicarious learning. Our findings challenge some standard assumptions about vicarious learning. First, we show that the learning in a repository does not come from referent others. Instead, it emerges directly from failure events that might ordinarily be dismissed as noise. Second, we show that the learning does not come from copying others. Instead, it is constructed by firm members as they assemble individual failure events to identify possibilities they had not considered. Third, in contrast to vicarious learning, where the referent others and rare events provide the context, repository-based learning requires that actors impose their own context as part of the learning process. Our qualitative and quantitative evidence serve explanatory purposes by showing how firms use a repository of failure events to identify moments of valid learning, and they serve exploratory purposes by investigating how we can demonstrate reliable learning from a repository of failure events.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1179","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['failure events', 'learning', 'repository']","The article focuses on learning from failure events in the medical device industry without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

Our exploration of this understudied source of credit unearths important questions about the reasons employers lend money to employees, the manner in which they decide to make formal or informal loans, and the coveted benefits employers derive from lending to their workers. Considering the pervasiveness and significance of loan choices among small firms, and the absence of studies on the topic, we tackle these questions through an analysis of 459 informal and formal loans issued by 83 small business owners to their employees.

Research suggests that greater platform adoption benefits complements by providing more potential users, but this assumes that platform adopters are homogeneous. We build on extensive research exploring the heterogeneity between early and late platform adopters to identify counterintuitive dynamics for complements. Complements launched early in a platform\u2019s life cycle face an audience entirely of early platform adopters, whereas later-launching complements face a mixed audience of both early and late adopters, and we argue that differences in preferences and behavior between early and late adopters affect whether complements will succeed and which types will be most successful. We explore these dynamics in the context of the console video game industry using a unique data set of 2,918 video games released in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2007. We show that despite the increase in the potential user pool as the platform evolves, video games launched later in the platform life cycle realize lower sales than those launched earlier. While increased competition explains part of this effect, we show substantial evidence consistent with our theory of preference differences between early and late adopters. This includes the finding that the negative effect is stronger for novel games and that the gap between popular and less popular complements widens as later adopters move into the platform, consistent with late adopters being risk averse and seeking to avoid purchasing mistakes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1183","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on platform dynamics and consumer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We explain the opportunities from surfacing abductive reasoning in H-D where it already exists; from explicitly acknowledging abductive reasoning as a complement in building logical chains in H-D; and from using abductive reasoning as a substitute for H-D logic when a body of knowledge exhibits inconsistent, contradictory, or discrepant results. We elaborate strategies for data search and selection, data production and compilation, and analytical corroboration. Our overall argument is that the deliberate use of abductive reasoning in hypothetico-deductive projects has distinct advantages stemming from an explicitly tight connection between data and theory.

We test these hypotheses by drawing on a unique data set of two whole networks in the healthcare industry in the Netherlands in which both the \u201cobjective\u201d network structure and the organizational perceptions of that structure are assessed. The empirical analyses revealed considerable differences among organizations in terms of the accuracy of their network information, especially with regard to accuracy about different parts of the network.

Using qualitative data from multiple properties managed by a hotel management firm, we find that individuals develop and then become committed to achieving budget goals through a ritual of quantification. The budget numbers serve as output controls for the properties and employees. We find that the strength of the budget number as an undisputed future projection emerges from the ritualistic intertwining of process and normative controls in the course of producing a robust output control. Process controls delineate stages in the budgeting cycle, while normative controls (performative work and emotional investment) operate at each stage, propelling people from one stage to the next while also increasing commitment to both the process and the outcome. The result is a single reified budget number.

Across two studies, we demonstrate that people who are worried about their financial situation have less cognitive capacity available to them, which subsequently spills over into their work performance. In Study 1, we demonstrate this relationship in a field study with short-haul truck drivers where we combine survey responses with lagged archival data on preventable accidents. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in financial worry is associated with a 0.4% increase in the probability of a preventable accident because of its detrimental effects on cognitive capacity. In Study 2, we establish the causal ordering among the variables by manipulating financial worry in a laboratory environment using a driving simulation task, confirming the results of Study 1.

Yet while studies have examined the former, the actual trade-offs that these organizations face\u2014and how these might vary among enterprises and contexts\u2014has been largely overlooked. Focusing on social enterprise, we address these gaps by (1) developing a framework that can be used to predict the compatibility of social outreach and financial sustainability for different types of enterprises and (2) arguing that the acuteness of trade-offs will vary based on the cultural roots of the issue an enterprise addresses, the market conditions where it operates, and the quality of its management. We test our arguments by studying 2,037 microfinance organizations in 115 nations between 1995 and 2013. Results support our predictions. Social\u2013financial trade-offs are amplified when a social issue is intertwined with deep-seated cultural problems, such as discrimination, and when an enterprise operates in a weak institutional environment. Intensive social outreach becomes sustainable, however, when cultural barriers to outreach are low, market-supporting institutions are strong, and an enterprise is professionally managed. Our study thus shows that social\u2013financial trade-offs are contingent and that the promise of sustainable social outreach varies widely across contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1188","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['social outreach', 'sustainability', 'discrimination', 'cultural barriers', 'social enterprise']","The article discusses the relationship between social outreach and financial sustainability, emphasizing the impact of cultural issues such as discrimination.

Extending current ambidexterity theory, we suggest that not only firms pursuing one-sided exploration or exploitation orientations show self-reinforcing tendencies but also ambidextrous firms adopting balanced exploration\u2013exploitation orientations. Integrating formal modeling arguments, we further propose that reinforcing ambidexterity can be good or bad for firms\u2019 long-term performance, depending on the environment they face: In contexts characterized by incremental change, firms benefit more from the learning effects of maintaining ambidexterity, which lead to superior performance. Firms in discontinuous change contexts, however, suffer more from the misalignment that reinforcement creates, which affects their performance negatively. A longitudinal data set of global insurance firms (1999\u20132014) supports our arguments. Building on these findings, we reconceptualize ambidexterity as the ability to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, which emerges from combining capability-building processes (to balance exploration and exploitation) with capability-shifting processes (to adapt the exploration\u2013exploitation balance). We contribute to the organizational literature by developing a dynamic perspective on balancing exploration and exploitation, by clarifying the contingent nature of the ambidexterity\u2013firm performance relationship, and by integrating and extending the ambidexterity and formal modeling perspectives on exploration and exploitation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1189","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of ambidexterity in firms and their performance outcomes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Product promotion is a prototypical setting in which employees are mandated to express attitudes that are often not fully sincere. On the basis of social projection theory, we predicted that organizational agents mandated to express insincere attitudes project their self-perceived dishonesty onto others and thus become more distrustful. An initial large-scale, multi-country field study found that individuals employed in jobs requiring product promotion were less trusting than individuals employed in other jobs\u2014particularly jobs in which honesty is highly expected. We then conducted two experiments in which people were tasked with promoting low-quality products and either were allowed to be honest or were asked to be positive (as would be expected of most salespeople). We found that mandated attitude expression reduced willingness to trust, and this effect was mediated by a decrease in the perceived honesty of the self, which, in turn, reduced the perceived honesty of other people. Our research suggests that the widely used practice of mandating attitude expression has the effect of undermining an essential ingredient of economic functioning\u2014trust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1190","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['trust', 'honesty', 'mandated attitude expression']","The article discusses the implications of mandated attitude expression on trust and honesty in organizational settings, which touches on ethical considerations in management practices.

To attract these resources, firms employ various substantive and rhetorical signals, such as publishing press releases, showcasing prototypes of new products, and hiring renowned managers. However, despite the relevance of signals, we still know little about how they interact\u2014whether they strengthen, weaken, or neutralize one another\u2014in attracting resources. Traditional signaling theory downplays the importance of rhetoric while management research acknowledges its relevance, creating a disconnect between these two camps and a shortcoming that deserves further investigation. To address this shortcoming, we advance the concept of signal portfolios. Signal portfolios may combine rhetorical signals with substantive signals. We employ this concept to explain how the interaction of the two affects financial resource acquisition in high-noise environments\u2014settings where firms send multiple signals simultaneously. Based on longitudinal data on crowdfunding, an exemplary high-noise environment, we find that rhetorical signals complement substantive signals in certain situations and, thus, strengthen their impact on a firm\u2019s financial resource acquisition.

Yet organizations frequently attempt to reuse knowledge from outside their boundaries, which may be even more challenging. The practice is so prevalent that an entire industry\u2014the consulting industry\u2014has developed to support it. Unfortunately, we understand little about how knowledge embedded in one organization is used to intervene in another and about what challenges follow from the attempt to do so. In this paper, we aim to address these questions. On the basis of an analysis of four months of ethnographic fieldwork and extensive archival data surrounding an engagement between a leading consulting firm and a multihospital healthcare system, we find that partners and senior executives created generalizations based on their experience and encouraged junior consultants and hospital employees to apply these generalizations and reuse old solutions. Yet junior consultants, who had different backgrounds and were embedded in particular contexts, struggled to reuse solutions, and they instead developed novel insights through the engagement. We argue, moreover, that the ultimate success of consulting engagements lies in this division of labor within and across firms. Our work contributes to the literatures on knowledge reuse, organizational learning, and consulting by illuminating how knowledge is (or is not) reused and how differences between junior and senior consultants, and between consultants and clients, shape both the reuse of existing solutions and the development of new ones.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1196","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['knowledge reuse', 'diversity', 'consulting']","The article discusses the challenges of knowledge reuse across organizations, touching on the diversity of backgrounds among junior consultants.

Noncontrolling but still substantial state ownership signals to private coinvestors that states will maintain initial investment project terms yet limit interference in project management under those same initial terms. Analyses of 1,373 investment projects announced in 95 host countries from 1990 to 2012 support this proposition: (1) low policy stability in the host country increases investment risk, measured as the percentage of equity comprising all project capital funding on the announcement date, but (2) minority state ownership diminishes the risk-increasing impact of low policy stability, and (3) the risk-diminishing effect is greatest when policy stability is low and the state holds from 21% to 40% of investment project equity.

A Study of the Appropriation Puzzle in Actively Managed Mutual Funds","How do firms benefit from employees with transferable skills? The prevailing view is that labor market frictions that impede employee mobility or strategies that constrain skill transferability are the primary instruments for firms to appropriate value from human capital. The empirical evidence, however, suggests that employees continue to be mobile, and firms pay premiums to attract and retain employees with transferable skills. To reconcile theory with data, we use data from the mutual fund industry, where it is widely documented that active fund managers appropriate more value than they generate. We develop a theory of positive externalities stemming from transferable human capital that we argue accrue mostly to the firm, and provide evidence of such externalities in the mutual fund context. Empirically, we decompose the skills of mutual fund managers into task- and firm-specific components and argue that managers with task-specific skills generate positive externalities at the firm level that are not reflected in their performance measured at the fund level. We advance and test empirical hypotheses on the existence of these positive unmeasured externalities by examining whether managers with task-specific skills are more likely to be associated with activities such as mentoring, increased risk taking, and generating spillovers at the firm level. Our results show that managers with task-specific skills are indeed associated with greater positive externalities, compared with managers with firm-specific skills. We discuss the implications of our results for the literature on human capital value creation and appropriation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2017.1197","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['transferable skills', 'human capital', 'positive externalities']","The article discusses the appropriation of value from employees with transferable skills, which touches on themes of human capital and workplace dynamics.

Because high-status incumbents can better cope with the shock in the internal allocation of resources produced by high-status newcomers, we expect that they will experience a lower performance decline than low-status incumbents.

However, most research has focused on single overall, high-level organizational goals while ignoring important operational goals farther down in the goal hierarchy. This paper explores the important issue of interdependent feedback on multiple operational goals with shared task environments. We conjecture about the impact of shared technological task environments on feedback across goals. We then empirically examine these conjectures using panel vector autoregression (PVAR) analysis of performance feedback from three strategically important operational goals with shared technological task environments in the automobile industry. We find that interdependent feedback can lead to severe and misleading confusion regarding learning from feedback on such goals with shared task environments. Then, we discuss the implications of our findings. These include the following: the absolute intractability of the problem of meeting multiple goals with interdependent task environments as the number of goals increases; limits on the modularity of organization structure; and severe challenges in ex post credit assignment and ex ante planning when goals share technological task environments.

Once undertaken, structural recombination can lead to novel architectural opportunities that enable greater innovation and long-term performance. However, little research exists that explores whether and to what extent a focal module may be readily available for recombinatory opportunities in the first place. In this paper, I investigate the design hierarchy choices related to visibility and information hiding in organizational module designs (i.e., business divisions). In a longitudinal sample of 222 divisions in 18 of the largest European universal banks, I find support for modularity-informed predictions in which visibility and information hiding affect module recombination decisions. In a post hoc analysis, I explore a complementary theoretical explanation of divisions and subunits engaging in political influence. The post hoc results suggest the existence of both a design and a politics component in recombination efforts. I therefore propose that in an organizational context, integrating a political lens into the modularity framework may be of great value in deepening our understanding of how reorganization decisions come about.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2018.1210","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['political influence', 'modularity', 'organizational design']","The article discusses organizational design and political influence, which hints at some awareness of power dynamics within organizations.

However, there are examples of knowledge sharing among competitors that cannot fully be explained using these relational mechanisms. In this study, I propose that in markets where competitors are a set of key stakeholders, knowledge sharing is a strategic response to high levels of buy-in uncertainty related to a potential opportunity, namely, the likelihood that stakeholders will come to realize the value of a potential opportunity in a timely fashion. Using a unique data set of knowledge sharing among investment professionals on a digital platform, this study leverages variation in the platform\u2019s knowledge-sharing structure to test this theory. I find that knowledge sharing among these competitors is most likely when buy-in uncertainty for a given opportunity is high and that this knowledge sharing does lead to subsequent buy-in.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2018.1214","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge sharing', 'competitors', 'stakeholders']","The article discusses knowledge sharing among competitors but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We reconcile these conflicting views by focusing on a novel mechanism: the role slack time plays in the endogenous allocation of time and effort to innovative projects. We develop a theoretical model that distinguishes between periods of high- (work weeks) versus low- (break weeks) opportunity costs of time. Low-opportunity cost time during break weeks may induce (1) lower quality ideas to be developed (a selection effect); (2) more effort to be applied for any given idea quality (an effort effect); and (3) an increase in the use of teams because scheduling is less constrained (a coordination effect). As a result, the effect of an increase in slack time on innovative outcomes is ambiguous, because the selection effect may induce more low-quality ideas, whereas the effort and coordination effect may lead to more high-quality, complex ideas. We test this framework using data on college breaks and on 165,410 Kickstarter projects across the United States. Consistent with our predictions, during university breaks, more projects are posted in the focal regions, and the increase is largest for projects of either very high or very low quality. Furthermore, projects posted during breaks are more complex, and involve larger teams with diverse skills. We discuss the implications for the design of policies on slack time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2018.1215","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['diverse skills', 'teams', 'innovation']","The article discusses the role of slack time in fostering innovation and mentions the involvement of larger teams with diverse skills, which hints at themes of diversity and collaboration.

Our data set contains almost 180,000 submissions that reflect signals of direct performance evaluation from both the community and the firm. Our data set also contains almost 150 million ratings that reflect signals for learning from observing the completed work of others. We have three key findings. First, we find a period of initial investment with decreased performance. This is because individuals struggle to synthesize learnable signals from early performance evaluation. This finding is contrary to other studies that report faster learning from early direct experience when improvements are easiest to achieve. Second, we find that individuals consistently improve their performance from observing others\u2019 good examples. However, whether they improve from observing others\u2019 bad examples depends on their ability to correctly recognize that work as being of low quality.

We investigate how location characteristics linked to Marshallian forces, such as local knowledge spillovers, R&D rivalry, dense industry employment, and the strength of professional organizations, have an impact on the specification of formal governance mechanisms. In particular, these Marshallian forces have a bearing on formal governance mechanisms that safeguard the execution of the R&D partnership, such as joint administrative interfaces and termination provisions. We analyze R&D partnerships between biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms and find that misappropriation hazards arising from greater knowledge spillovers and R&D competition in the region where R&D activities are located promote the use of these formal governance mechanisms in R&D partnerships. We also find that factors supporting thick interpersonal networks, such as the intensity of sectoral employment and the strength of professional bodies, reduce the use of formal governance mechanisms in R&D partnerships.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2018.1221","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['governance', 'safeguards', 'R&D partnerships']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of governance in R&D partnerships without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The Role of Star vs. Nonstar Collaborators in Creative Settings","Creative stars make disproportionately influential contributions to their fields. Yet we know little about how an innovator\u2019s creative performance is affected by collaborating with stars. This paper studies the creative aspects of interpersonal collaboration from a distinct perspective: the quality of the collaborator. Both star and nonstar collaborators provide different benefits to a focal innovator. The innovator benefits from collaborating with nonstars because they may provide access to diverse information improving the outcome of the creative task at hand. In contrast, the focal innovator benefits from collaborating with stars because the focal innovator can also experience and learn from the star\u2019s superior set of creative synthesis skills (which integrate diverse, sometimes contradictory ideas into new coherent and holistic solutions) and, thus, build lasting creative capabilities. Building on theoretical arguments about those two different collaboration purposes, we first examine how a star collaboration (versus a nonstar collaboration) affects a comprehensive measure of an innovator\u2019s creativity: the likelihood of emerging as a star. Second, we examine how the different creative benefits of engaging with a star versus a nonstar collaborator affect the effect of two widely studied aspects of interpersonal collaboration on star emergence: social network cohesion and expertise similarity. In contrast to collaborations with nonstars, for which social cohesion and expertise similarity limit access to diverse information, negatively affecting star emergence, social network cohesion and expertise similarity have a decidedly positive effect on star collaborations by improving the transfer of the star\u2019s set of creative skills.

On one hand, aspirations serve an evaluative role as a benchmark for assessing performance. On the other, they have an allocative role in influencing the acquisition of limited resources. Our theory suggests that managers strategically adapt organizational aspirations to balance the tension between the two concerns. They set more aggressive aspirations when facing increased pressure to acquire resources, but set more conservative targets when the costs of missing performance targets are higher. In the context of annual management forecasts, which allow us to directly observe performance targets and their deviation from traditional aspiration measures, we find that external factors influencing the intensity of resource pressure and the cost of missing performance targets determine the aggressiveness of organizational aspirations.

Although scholars have largely settled on behavioral bias as the cause, we suggest that this consensus is premature. These mistakes may also arise from a process in which entrepreneurs continually learn about their prospects and make entry and exit decisions based on what they have learned. We develop a computational model of this process that connects pre- and post-entry learning and can be directed to analyze Bayesian-rational or biased entrepreneurs. The model suggests that, to outside observers, rational entrepreneurs may appear overconfident, seem to take too long to exit, and exhibit a positive correlation between entry cost and persistence in the market. When examining confidence biases, the model suggests that entrepreneurs whose biases cause them to perform the worst after entry will be most likely to enter, that pre-entry learning induces a positive correlation between distinct confidence biases among entrants, and that exit changes the prevalence of certain biases in the surviving population of entrants over time. Our study also speaks to recent work on pre-entry experience that documents the transfer of knowledge from parent to progeny firms, suggesting that, in addition to inheritance, differential performance may also be the result of heterogeneity in the length and quality of pre-entry learning during which an opportunity is assessed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2018.1225","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on behavioral biases in entrepreneurial decision-making without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Applying recent advances in qualitative comparative analysis to a sample of 137 buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry, we show that there are multiple equifinal pathways to high and low opportunism. In general, our study shows that it is easier to avoid high opportunism than to consistently achieve low opportunism. On this basis, we offer new insights into countering opportunism for researchers and managers. Achieving low opportunism requires a combination of governance mechanisms, which are generally not interchangeable. In particular, relational governance mechanisms in isolation seem to be more restricted than prior research has suggested but form a powerful synergistic combination with complex contracts. Although formal governance mechanisms lack enforceability, the coordination and monitoring that they provide are critical in both avoiding high opportunism and achieving low opportunism. Performance ambiguity is especially difficult to manage.

They shape how individuals perceive their career prospects, which types of opportunities they pursue, how they get work done within organizations, and how they balance this work with the rest of their life. Organizations themselves also shape and are shaped by gender dynamics, from the ways they design jobs and performance evaluation systems to the assumptions managers make about individuals\u2019 preferences and motivations. This virtual special issue collects together 14 papers published in Organization Science that challenge common understandings about the sources of gender differences in career outcomes, the effects of balancing work\u2013life obligations, and the ways that gender dynamics play out in teams and organizations. An important insight that emerges from a comparison of these studies is that demand effects are often confused for supply effects.

The provider decides not only her own effort but also the client's, at least to some extent. The client gives the review based on his net utility upon service completion. We develop a signal\u2010jamming model in which the provider's inherent capability or type is unobservable, and the market infers the provider type through observable signals such as the service outcome, the client review, or both. We show that compared to the benchmark case when the service outcome is observed as a signal, the client review generally leads to less effort of both the provider and the client. The review hence tends to sacrifice the service effectiveness in favor of the efficiency of the client's effort input. Nevertheless, when clients incorporate private information about the provider type into their reviews, service providers are better motivated to devote effort. Interestingly, we find the provider's effort choices may be either strategic complements or substitutes. With a reasonable level of informativeness, online reviews could lead to favorable performance in service effectiveness, client effort efficiency, and provider type distinguishability. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that when both the review and the outcome are available, the provider may lack sufficient incentive to devote effort, resulting in inferior distinguishability of provider types. It thus illustrates that richer information may not necessarily generate favorable strategic outcomes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12592","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['collaborative services', 'client review', 'service effectiveness']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of service provision and client reviews without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We compare two widely used policies by the trade association in practice: exclusionary information exchange and non\u2010exclusionary information exchange. Under the exclusionary policy, only retailers who contribute their private information are exposed to the pool of shared information, whereas under the non\u2010exclusionary policy, all of the members of the trade association are exposed to the pool of shared information regardless of any contribution to this pool. We show that when the wholesale price is exogenous, the retailers have an incentive to share information under both policies. However, when the manufacturer is aware of the exchange of information among the retailers, she sets the wholesale price more aggressively, even without being exposed to the actual shared information. This wholesale pricing effect reduces the retailers' incentives to share information to such extent that under the non\u2010exclusionary policy, no information is shared in equilibrium. Under the exclusionary policy, it is possible to reach a full information\u2010sharing equilibrium, but this equilibrium can make the retailers worse\u2010off compared with the case in which no information is shared. Furthermore, it is also possible for the manufacturer to become worse\u2010off when the retailers share information. We also discuss the effect of market size on the incentives of the retailers to exchange information and how by committing to a certain wholesale price level early, the manufacturer can induce the retailers to exchange information.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12603","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of information sharing and pricing strategies within a trade association, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

By examining the optimal levels of IT capability for different port systems from the viewpoint of production cost and transaction cost, we find theoretical evidence to explain why a port system with a horizontal competitive governance mode is less successful at integrating a port IT system in practice. Moreover, we find that the optimal IT capability of an individual port operator is lower than the IT capability in an integrated heterogeneous system. We further investigate how to improve IT capability to the desired system level through different forms of an incentive system that includes a subsidy offered by the port authority to coordinate the entire port system. The fixed subsidy is found to be the most cost\u2010effective and the easiest to implement. In addition, considering that information about effort cost for IT capability can be private under a market or hybrid governance mode, we study the performance of a direct revelation mechanism when revealing the port operator's private information and true cost to the port authority.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12663","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IT capability and performance in port operations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This very phenomenon has led to IT OEMs finding themselves selling new generation models only to be left holding returned merchandise from older generations. Similarly, customers who migrate to newer generations of products experience uncertainty about how to dispose of older but functional IT equipment. Online liquidation markets have emerged to address these needs by finding ways to resell this equipment. On these liquidation markets, sellers of out\u2010of\u2010date or lightly used durable items like computers and tablets can transact with buyers interested in these products at discounted prices, without needing to alter the state/quality of the product. There is limited understanding of how these markets function and how they may be designed to increase their effectiveness. We report on a unique opportunity for a field experiment that was conducted through the co\u2010operation of a large liquidation company (wholesale liquidator) for IT equipment in the United States. With the specific intention of understanding the design of these liquidation auctions, the research site allowed us to conduct a field experiment on their auction platform for different categories of iPad tablets. By manipulating auction starting prices, we are able to provide insight into the effect of starting prices on the final auction prices of the returned IT products, and find evidence of cross\u2010product dependencies.

Public betas are adopted by innovator consumers and firms use free feedback from these consumers to improve the quality of the product. While trying out the public beta, innovators also learn their product preferences accurately. In addition, opinions expressed by the innovators about the software on public forums like blogs, etc., can introduce a perception bias about the product's quality among the imitator consumers. Therefore, there are demand and cost side tradeoffs in introducing public betas. In addition to public beta, firms can introduce product trials along with the product. Product trials serve as a learning mechanism for all consumers (innovators and imitators), unlike in the case of public betas where this benefit accrues only to innovators. We examine the firm's optimal strategies to introduce public beta and/or product trial. We show that introducing public beta does not necessarily result in a higher\u2010quality product. However, even when the quality is lower, consumer surplus and social welfare can be higher. Interestingly, while introducing public beta in addition to trial may appear to be optimal, it may not always be so. We show that similar results hold for products with network effects.

Health Information Technology, Length of Stay, and Readmission Risk","Adequate length of stay (LOS) during hospitalization is not only a critical determinant of quality of care, but can be a useful predictor of the risk of future readmissions. Recent studies have shown alarming evidence that the United States leads developed nations in terms of shorter hospital stays, rendering patients with greater risk of future readmissions. We focus on deviation between hospital LOS and the geometric mean LOS (GMLOS), a guideline for care delivery stipulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Our objective is to establish the relationship between LOS and readmission risk, examine the role of health IT in reducing the deviation of LOS, and address cost trade\u2010offs between early discharges and readmissions. Based on a large panel of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients during a 4\u2010year period, we find that implementation of health IT applications is associated with a reduction in the deviation between LOS and GMLOS. This deviation is associated with a significant increase in future 30\u2010day readmission risk. Patients whose inpatient stays are shorter than the GMLOS guideline, by 1\u00a0day or more, are likely to exhibit a 1.1% greater risk of readmission, and even shorter stays are likely to further exacerbate their readmission risk. Further, we find that the total readmission costs are much higher than the costs incurred in keeping patients longer during their initial hospital visit.

We study the management of electric vehicle (EV) fleets organized in VPPs as a way to address the challenges posed by the inflexible energy supply of renewable sources. In particular, we analyze the potential of parked EVs to absorb electricity from the grid, and provide electricity back to the grid when needed. A fleet owner can either charge, discharge for renting, discharge to the grid, or keep an EV idle. A unique property of our mixed rental\u2010trading strategy is that decisions are made between making an EV available for rental, where the location within the city matters (drivers want a car to be close to their place of departure or arrival) and for discharging it to the grid, where location does not matter (vehicles can discharge to the grid from any capable charging point). We study the feasibility of VPPs for a fleet of 1500 real EVs on the \u201cNord Pool Spot,\u201d a North European electricity spot market.

One such example is a federal regulation known as the Value\u2010based Purchasing (VBP) program, which shifts hospital reimbursements for services rendered away from a fee\u2010for\u2010service model to a value\u2010based model. This change requires hospitals to more accurately track and document resources/assets utilized in the delivery of care, in addition to appropriate health outcomes. Hence, the focus of this study is on assessing the effect of the joint use of RFID and EDI on hospital performance, namely supply chain cost efficiency, personnel expenses, and hospital readmission rates. The findings, based on secondary, longitudinal data on more than 3300 US hospitals spanning eight years, suggest that hospitals bundling RFID and EDI experience an initial decrease in supply chain cost efficiency and increase in personnel expenses, with no immediate impact on readmission rates. However, over time, better supply chain cost efficiency, lower personnel expenses, and a consistent reduction in readmission rates accrue from the long\u2010term and consistent leveraging of the RFID\u2010EDI bundle. Thus, the overarching contribution of this study is the elucidation of how and along what measures the bundled leveraging of RFID and EDI improves hospital performance, as well as which measures of hospital performance are time (in)variant.

Our conditional logit analysis shows that hospital relationship plays a more dominant role in determining transfer destinations than distance and quality.

The lack of studies linking internal service quality (ISQ) to clinical performance creates a gap in healthcare operations management theory and\u2014from a practice standpoint\u2014might contribute to underinvestment in the quality of services delivered by internal support departments. To address these issues, we test whether higher ISQ is associated with a lower rate of adverse events. We leverage a unique dataset from a hospital that developed a measure of ISQ provided by support departments. Using over a year's worth of monthly data on the average ISQ delivered by 11 support departments to five nursing units, we test the impact of ISQ on two nursing\u2010sensitive adverse events: patient falls with injury and hospital\u2010acquired pressure ulcers. We find support for our hypothesis that higher levels of ISQ are associated with lower rates of adverse events, controlling for patient acuity and other confounding factors. Our results show that improving the overall average ISQ received by a nursing unit by 0.1 on a 5\u2010point scale has almost the same benefit for reducing adverse events as would increasing staffing on that unit by one full\u2010time equivalent nurse.

We illustrate a mechanism which can increase the supply of cadaveric kidneys in the United States. This supply increase exploits the fact that under the current organ allocation policy, some kidneys remain unprocured in some procurement areas but would be highly sought in other areas. The current kidney allocation policy procures within a donor service area (DSA) and offers these kidneys first to patients in the DSA; if these offers are not accepted, the kidney will be offered within the region (a cluster of DSAs); if these offers are not accepted, the kidney will be offered nationally. A deceased\u2010donor organ is procured if there is the belief that the offered organ will be transplanted (known as \u201cintent\u201d). We conduct an empirical analysis of the donor and recipient data (at the DSA level) which reveals that the intent increases significantly with organ quality, the median waiting time for a transplant, and higher competition. In particular, it shows that lower quality organs are likely to be procured at a higher rate in DSAs with longer waiting times. Motivated by a new kidney allocation system, we conduct a counterfactual study which shows that geographically broader sharing the bottom 15% quality kidneys leads to stronger intent for the organ, thus increasing the supply of procured organs available for transplantation.

Moreover, although the oncologist has additional information about a patient's risk, he cannot always benefit from this private information.

Our analysis reveals that there exists a threshold for the capacity cost coefficient, above which product sharing will increase the manufacturer's optimal capacity and below which it will reduce the manufacturer's optimal capacity. We find that the sharing market tends to increase the retailer's share of the gross profit margin in the channel. Furthermore, the existence of the sharing market tends to benefit the firms when capacity is relatively costly to build, but it is more likely to increase the retailer's profit than the manufacturer's profit, that is, product sharing can sometimes benefit the downstream retailer at the expense of the upstream manufacturer.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12794","research article","POM","Operations Management","3","['collaborative consumption', 'product sharing', 'consumer']","The article discusses collaborative consumption and product sharing, which reflect some awareness of alternative economic models.

In this paper, we study the problems of staffing and controlling queueing systems with an uncertain number of servers and impatient customers. Because randomness in the number of servers creates congestion in the system, the customer abandonment distribution plays an important role. We characterize how it affects both the optimal staffing policy and the cost incurred by the manager. Because of strong dependence on the abandonment distribution, it is natural to investigate ways of controlling customer abandonment behavior so as to mitigate that cost. Here, we propose doing so by making delay announcements in the system. We characterize how the manager may use three controls in her toolbox, staffing, compensation, and the announcements, to effectively control her system. We show that despite jointly optimizing the usage of those three controls, it may be cost effective for the manager to understaff, overstaff, or match supply and demand in any given shift.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12796","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of queueing theory and operational efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The MNF relies on a contract manufacturer (CM) to produce its products, which serve both markets within (domestic market) and outside (overseas market) China. The MNF is assumed to be monopolistic in the overseas market but faces competition from a local original equipment manufacturer (OEM) who outsources both manufacturing and component procurement to the CM. The MNF will decide whether to control its component procurement (consignment strategy) or delegate that function to the CM (turnkey strategy). Our study indicates that a number of factors unique to the global supply chain environment, such as a multi\u2010market structure with different sizes and natures of competition, and a set of tax rules that gives differential treatment to products serving different markets, have the potential of impacting the MNF's choice of consignment vs. turnkey strategies, sometimes in interesting ways. In particular, we find that when attempting to balance the pros and cons of cooperating with the local OEM under turnkey while competing against it in the domestic market, the MNF's preference could switch twice from turnkey to consignment and back to turnkey, and its global profits could first decrease and then increase, as the domestic market grows.

For instance, a manufacturers\u2019 retail arm provides consumers with the instant gratification of product purchase and the benefit of in\u2010store shopping assistance, whereas their online arm offers potential benefits by selling to market segments that value shopping convenience, product variety, availability, and customization. The main difference between these two channels is that consumers cannot \u201ctouch and feel\u201d the product before they make an online purchase, whereas they can physically inspect and often even experience the product before making an in\u2010store purchase. As a consequence, the online arm implies a higher degree of uncertainty about product fit than the retail arm. The ensuing possibility that consumers will return the product, due to product misfit, might impact the manufacturer's design of the channels of distribution. We show that product marginal value and salvage value for product returns determine whether the manufacturer will sell his product through \u201cbricks\u201d only, \u201cbricks and clicks,\u201d or \u201cclicks\u201d only.

Using an industry studies approach, we build on these theoretical perspectives to examine order fulfillment at a global automotive producer. Interviews with key decision makers and a statistical analysis of 48,534 individual vehicle sales enable the development of four propositions on the organizational and profitability implications of the firm's evolution in order fulfillment strategy. Our analyses indicate that building products to customer order is a source of higher unit profit margin. The BTO process also exposes fault lines and generates opportunities for operational improvement, both in the order\u2010to\u2010delivery system and in the broader organization.

For example, social media and review websites suffer from sentiment manipulations, manifested in the form of opinion spam and fake reviews. The consequence of such manipulations is the deterioration of information quality as well as loss in consumer welfare. We study one of movie studios' operation activities, sentiment manipulation, in the context of movie tweets. Using the movie release and movie studios' earning announcement dates as sources of exogenous shocks, we find that both the average Twitter sentiment and the proportion of highly positive tweets exhibit a significant drop on the movie's release day or movie studios' earnings announcement day. In addition, independent productions and low budget movies tend to experience a larger drop than major studio productions and high budget movies. To examine the effect of competition on firm manipulation, we construct a movie competition measure based on both the time and theme dimensions through topic modeling, and we find that a higher level of competition leads to a larger drop in Twitter sentiment. Overall, these observations suggest that firms might be actively managing online sentiment in a strategic manner.

We study a collaborative prototyping scenario in which a manufacturer involves a supplier in the prototyping process by letting the supplier make detailed design choices for critical components and provide prototypes for testing. While the supplier can obtain private information about the costs, the manufacturer uses target costing to gain control over the design choice. We show that involving the supplier in the prototyping process has an important influence on the manufacturer's optimal decisions. The collaboration results in information asymmetry, which makes parallel prototyping less attractive and potentially reverses the optimal testing sequence under sequential prototyping: It may be optimal to test designs in increasing order of attractiveness to avoid that the supplier does not release technically and economically feasible prototypes for strategic reasons. We also find that the classical target costing approaches (cost\u2010 and market\u2010based) need to be adjusted in the presence of alternative designs: Due to the strategic behavior of suppliers, it is not always optimal to provide identical target costs for designs with similar cost and performance estimates, nor to provide different target costs for dissimilar designs. Furthermore, the timing is important: While committing upfront to carefully chosen target costs reduces the supplier's strategic behavior, in some circumstances, the manufacturer can take advantage of this behavior by remaining flexible and specifying the second prototype's target costs later.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12811","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['collaboration', 'supplier', 'design choices']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of prototyping and cost estimation without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Thus, understanding how to safeguard their IP from poaching, which is a supplier's unauthorized use of a buyer's proprietary information, is of critical practical importance for manufacturers that outsource to suppliers in countries with weak IP rights. To investigate this phenomenon, we use dyadic data from globally dispersed manufacturer\u2013supplier relationships to examine how the IP rights of a supplier's location affects poaching and how IP rights influence the effectiveness of two transactional characteristics\u2014supplier idiosyncratic investments and media\u2010rich communication\u2014on poaching.

We find that the strength of IP rights not only has a direct effect on poaching, but it also influences the relationships for both transaction characteristics. Intriguingly, when IP rights are weak, we find that not only are supplier idiosyncratic investments less effective in reducing poaching, but increases in these investments are associated with an increase in poaching. This finding illustrates that the strength of IP rights is a determinant of the degree to which supplier idiosyncratic investments are transaction specific. For suppliers in countries with weak IP rights, media\u2010rich communication is found to be more effective in reducing poaching.

We then consider a model with differentiated linear commissions for new and remanufactured products. We show that the incentives offered to a salesforce to induce effort can create conditions where a firm should not sell remanufactured products, even if the cost of remanufacturing is negligible. We demonstrate that this result holds for the compensation plan observed in practice of the focal firm as well as with differentiated linear commissions. We further find that linear sales commissions for remanufactured products should generally be lower than those for new products under both compensation models. However, commissions based on the total sales revenue generated by a salesperson, which do not differentiate between the sales of the two products, are not well suited for remanufacturing. This is because incentives based on total sales revenue result in unit sales commissions that are proportional to product prices, which always induce lower than optimal remanufactured product sales due to their lower prices.

To gain insight into how offering product upgrades impacts optimal price selection, we formulate a multiple period, nested two\u2010stage model where the firm first sets prices and replenishment levels for each product while the demand is still uncertain, and after observing the demand, decides how many (if any) of the customers to upgrade to a higher quality product. We characterize the structure of the optimal upgrade, pricing and replenishment policies and find that firms having greater flexibility to offer product upgrades can restrain their reliance on dynamic pricing, enabling them to better protect the price differentiation between the products. We also show how the quality differential between the products or changes in the replenishment cost structures influence the optimal policy. Using insights gained from the optimal policy structure, we construct a heuristic policy and find that it performs well across various parameter values.

Designing strategies for efficient distribution of malaria medications, such as Artemesinin Combination Therapies, is a key challenge in resource constrained countries. This paper develops a solution methodology that integrates strategic\u2010level and tactical\u2010level models to better manage pharmaceutical distribution through a three\u2010tier centralized health system, which is common to sub\u2010Saharan African countries. At the strategic level, we develop a two\u2010stage stochastic programming approach to address the problem of demand uncertainty. In the first stage, an initial round of shipments is sent before the malaria season to each local clinic from district hospitals, which receive medications from regional warehouses. After the malaria season begins, a recourse action is triggered to avoid shortages in the form of (i) lateral transshipment or (ii) delayed shipment. The optimal solutions developed by the strategic model identify small clinic clusters possessing exclusive transshipment policies. Therefore, we decompose the problem at the tactical level, solving each clinic cluster independently using a Markov decision process approach to determine optimal periodic transshipment policies. A case study of our proposed distribution system is performed for 290 facilities controlled by the Malawi Ministry of Health. Numerical analysis of Malawi's distribution system indicates that our proposed cluster\u2010based decomposition method could near optimally reduce shortage incidents.

Meanwhile, many online platforms have also started adopting the agency (model) contract, where the upstream firms decide the retail prices of products while the downstream platforms take a predetermined cut from each sale. This study examines the interaction between an upstream firm's add\u2010on strategy and a downstream online platform's distribution contract choice. We find that such a firm prefers bundling the add\u2010on and the core product together under the wholesale contract, but prefers retailing the add\u2010on separately under the agency contract. Our research thus is the first to suggest that the distribution contract can critically affect a firm's choice between add\u2010on pricing and bundling. On the platform side, we show that a higher commission rate does not always result in a higher profit for the platform under the agency contract. We further identify two conditions under which the platform prefers the agency contract over the wholesale contract: The commission rate for the platform cannot be too low, and the market potential of the add\u2010on cannot be too large. For the overall channel, we show that the interaction between add\u2010on pricing and distribution contracts leads to sub\u2010optimal channel performance.

Because SDUs are less richly staffed than ICUs, they are less costly to operate; however, they also are unable to provide the level of care required by the sickest patients. There is an ongoing debate in the medical community as to whether and how SDUs should be used. On one hand, an SDU alleviates ICU congestion by providing a safe environment for post\u2010ICU patients before they are stable enough to be transferred to the general wards. On the other hand, an SDU can take capacity away from the already over\u2010congested ICU. In this work, we propose a queueing model of patient flow through the ICU and SDU in order to determine when an SDU is needed, what size it should be, and what are the main drivers influencing these decisions. Using first\u2010 and second\u2010order analysis, we examine the tradeoff between reserving capacity in the ICU for the most critical patients and gaining additional capacity achieved by allocating nurses to the SDU due to the lower staffing requirement.

This paper studies the effects of VMI on a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer to shed light on when an IT investment for VMI adoption can be justified. We show that whether the two supply chain members benefit from VMI depends on how the holding or shortage cost increment from the manufacturer to retailer compares with two corresponding critical values. We then develop comparative statics results on how these critical values change with respect to different parameters. Interestingly, the retailer is more likely to benefit from the adoption of VMI when its inventory holding cost is low, and the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from VMI adoption when its inventory holding cost is high, contradicting what our intuitions would suggest and what has been prescribed in the literature.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12828","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational efficiency and the financial implications of vendor-managed inventory without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

By allowing customer information to be transferrable among service providers, portability in theory may help reduce switching costs and promote competition. Yet the actual consequences are unclear. To investigate this issue, we focus on the global wireless industry, and examine the impact of mobile number portability (MNP) policy. We construct a duopoly model with heterogeneous switching costs, which predicts that the market share of the large firm will shrink after MNP, while the average price may depend on firms\u2019 customer base composition. We test these hypotheses empirically on a panel dataset of 218 wireless operators in 52 countries over 6\u00a0years. We find relative market share gains for small firms and reductions for large firms under MNP. However, large firms can maintain higher prices than small firms. Probing deeper into customer segmentation, we find that on average, the share of contract customers increases for large firms after MNP, while it decreases for small firms. Large firms are able to retain higher\u2010value contract customers while small firms tend to attract lower\u2010value \u201cpay\u2010as\u2010you\u2010go\u201d customers.

In this study, we review recent research about using MTurk for behavioral experiments and test the validity of using MTurk for experiments in behavioral operations management. We recruited subjects from MTurk to replicate the inventory management experiment from Bolton and Katok (2008), as well as the procurement auction experiment from Engelbrecht\u2010Wiggans and Katok (2008), and the supply chain contracting experiment from Loch and Wu (2008). We successfully replicate individual biases in the inventory management and procurement auction experiments, but learning in the individual tasks occurs more slowly on MTurk compared to the original studies. Further, we find that social preference manipulations in the supply chain experiment are ineffective in changing the behavior of MTurk subjects, in contrast to the original study. We conducted an additional replication study of the supply chain contracting experiment using student subjects in a standard laboratory. Results from this laboratory replication also fail to replicate the original laboratory study, indicating that the effect of social preferences on supply chain contracting may not be robust to alternative subject pools.

We analyze two competitive strategies the incumbent provider: (a) deterring competitor entry, and (b) not deterring competitor entry. We also evaluate two service offering strategies of the incumbent provider: (a) offering both the premium and the standard service, and (b) offering the premium service only. Based on the results of our model, we present several useful managerial insights. First of all, we find that, under monopoly setting, it may sometimes be beneficial for the service provider to encourage higher usage despite the extra cost. Further, in the duopoly setting, higher customer usage impacts the Deter/Allow strategy choice and is neither always beneficial nor always detrimental to the incumbent provider, and such impact depends on profit margin and customer usage distribution. We also find that a larger market encourages the incumbent provider to add the standard service and switch between Allow and Deter strategies, since a larger market size may reduce the profit of an incumbent provider sticking to the Deter strategy. On the capacity side, we discover that the incumbent provider should strive to deter entry threats when it is at a cost advantage in a small market.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12843","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on competition strategies in cloud services without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study examines how a humanitarian organization can minimize the expected shortage in delivering relief aid to regions of need, either though surface or air transportation, in the presence of demand uncertainty with a budget constraint. The study makes four contributions. First, we show that when there is reserved supply for air transportation, it is optimal to provide a higher service level through surface shipment to regions with greater demand uncertainty. Second, we show that the demand variation plays a significant role in the allocation of funds between surface and air shipments. The reaction of the humanitarian organization to higher degrees of demand uncertainty can be determined by the optimal level of inventory purchased for surface shipment. If the optimal inventory for surface shipment is less than the mean demand, then we show that increasing degrees of demand uncertainty leads to increasing reliance on the air shipment option with greater levels of inventory reserved for air transportation and decreasing levels of inventory reserved for surface shipment. Third, when there are opportunities to invest in better forecasting, we find that a humanitarian organization should focus its resources on improving the demand forecast in one region as opposed to evenly allocating resources to all regions. Fourth, we show that the expected amount of shortages reduces with a higher number of regions to serve due to a risk\u2010pooling effect.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12849","research article","POM","Operations Management","5","['humanitarian', 'relief aid', 'demand uncertainty']","The article addresses the logistical challenges faced by humanitarian organizations, emphasizing the importance of delivering relief aid effectively.

This research is inspired by the metal cutting tools industry, where challenges regarding a key raw material present an opportunity for the manufacturers to create an alternative supply source by recycling. In this study, there is a virgin material market that supplies two manufacturers differentiated in their recycling ability. The problem is formulated as a game, where the manufacturers first make a decision to recycle or not, and then decide on their respective production quantities, and recycling rates. Depending on the fixed recycling cost relative to the unit cost of the virgin material, as well as the recycling cost structure of the two manufacturers, there are four possible equilibria: both manufacturers recycle, neither manufacturer recycles, only the more recycling\u2010capable manufacturer recycles, or a scenario with two Nash equilibria (either manufacturer recycles whereas the other does not). We show that recycling is indeed a strategic supply source resulting in higher quantities and profits. Interestingly, a manufacturer may recycle less if the unit cost of the virgin material increases, at high recycling rates. This result emphasizes the importance of carefully modeling the recycling cost structure. Although a recycled unit has necessarily a lower life\u2010cycle environmental impact than a unit made of virgin materials, the industry\u2010wide environmental impact can be higher in a recycling scenario due to higher production quantities overall.

In decentralized supply chains, however, these mitigating actions may be the supplier's responsibility yet are often not contractible. We show that wholesale price contracts, despite their simplicity, can perform well in inducing reliable supply, and we identify when and why they perform well. This could explain the widespread use of wholesale price contracts in business settings with unreliable supply. In particular, we investigate how the performance of wholesale price contracts depends on the interplay between the nature of supply risk and the type of procurement process. Supply risk is classified as random capacity when events such as labor strike disrupt the firm's ability to produce, or as random yield when manufacturing defects result in yield losses. The procurement process is classified as control when the buyer determines the production quantity, or as delegation when instead the supplier does. Analyzing the four possible combinations, we find that for random capacity, irrespective of the procurement process type, contract performance monotonically increases with the supplier's bargaining power; thus, wholesale price contracts perform well when the supplier is powerful. However, this monotonic trend is reversed for random yield with control: in that case, wholesale price contracts perform well when instead the buyer is powerful.

Bounded rationality induces customers to form different estimates of the service quality and leads the service provider to use pricing as a market segmentation tool, which is radically different from the full rationality setting. As customers gather more anecdotes, the service provider may first decrease and then increase price, and the revenue is U\u2010shaped. Interestingly, a larger sample size may harm consumer surplus, although it always benefits social welfare.

Recognizing time\u2010inconsistency of mean\u2010variance criteria, we employ the dynamic programming approach to obtain a time\u2010consistent policy.

We analyze two types of hedging instruments, vanilla hedges and exotic hedges, and show that inventory and financial hedging decisions can be separated in the presence of forward contracts and a myopic state\u2010dependent base stock policy is optimal. The optimal hedging policy can be obtained by minimizing the variance of the hedging portfolio, the value of excess inventory and the profit\u2010to\u2010go as a function of future price.

The intuition is that in face of the threat of supplier encroachment, sharing low demand information may prevent the supplier from establishing a direct selling channel, which will reduce downstream channel competition. This strategic effect of information sharing is new and only becomes dominant when there is an intermediate entry cost for encroachment and a high channel substitution rate. In contrast, when there are deviations from these conditions, the supplier's equilibrium encroachment decision is consistent and irrespective of the retailer's decision to share information, which makes withholding the demand information more beneficial to the retailer.

Specifically, the manufacturer can sell the product directly to consumers (named direct selling) or via a middleman retailer (named agent selling). The manufacturer then decides which distribution channel to adopt with an aim to maximize his profit. Under a newsvendor framework, the distribution channel structure endogenizes the procurement cost and thus impacts consumers\u2019 fairness perception and willingness to pay.

Using a two\u2010part tariff pricing scheme, a monopolist service provider can achieve higher profits by exploiting the dynamic inconsistency of customers in their sunk cost bias proclivity. In fact, the provider can achieve higher profits when sunk cost bias is higher or the dynamic inconsistency is greater.

We evaluate special cases of the two\u2010part tariff frequently used in practice such as conditional diagnosis fee, single rate time\u2010based fee, and free diagnosis and characterize their relative performance under different levels of bounded rationality. A conditional diagnosis fee, which is charged only if a customer leaves after diagnosis without treatment, does very well. Offering a free diagnosis and charging a high rate for treatment performs poorly. We also provide insights into a setting in which the market consists of two customer classes with different levels of sunk cost bias or dynamic inconsistency in preferences.

We characterize the optimal dynamic unbundling pricing policy and investigate its structural properties. We find that the value function with unbundling increases in the degree of dependence between consumers\u2019 reservation prices for basic service and add\u2010on. However, there are no similar monotonicity properties for the optimal price of the basic service. For several families of commonly used joint distributions, we show that the influence of the dependence parameter on the optimal price of the basic service depends on a threshold, which is a function of the dependence parameter. Moreover, the price of the bundled service is higher under unbundling when the add\u2010on price is high, and vice versa. Our model is then compared with the bundling model through a numerical experiment. Among most cases where unbundling outperforms, the degree of dependence is non\u2010negative. It is further revealed that given the non\u2010negativity of dependence, unbundling is worth practicing under the following situations: (i) the variance of the reservation price for the basic service (add\u2010on) is low (high); (ii) the mean of the reservation price for the basic service (add\u2010on) is high (low); (iii) the demand intensity is low; (iv) the capacity of the basic service is high; and (v) the incremental cost of the basic service (add\u2010on) is low (high).

Each firm manages resources to make a key component indispensable for final assembly by both firms. A horizontal subcontract stipulates that one of them prepares key component or even produces final product for the other. The subcontract can be signed before or after resource preparation, which we refer to as forward and spot subcontracting, respectively. With the presence of demand uncertainty, the subcontract is signed before (after, resp.) demand realization in forward (spot, resp.) subcontracting, while resources are always prepared in advance. Forward subcontracting enables the firms to achieve the maximum overall cost saving by concentrating all production activities in the more cost\u2010efficient firm. Spot subcontracting draws the firms to unilateral undertaking to prepare resources and cooperative resource allocation. This gives rise to an efficiency effect by balancing production and market selling between the firms, and a pooling effect that enables them to profit from synergies between markets. The subcontracting subject is crucial to the contribution of total cost saving relative to total revenue gain to the efficiency effect, but is inconsequential on the scale of the pooling effect.

The PBM develops a drug benefit plan for its clients, which includes a formulary list that specifies the copayment for each branded drug, and a list of prices to be charged to the clients for each of the branded and generic drugs. Client organizations decide whether to contract with the PBM and pay the majority of drug costs, while the plan enrollees select which drug to consume. An important feature when multiple branded drugs are distributed through a common PBM is that the PBM's market size, measured by the number of prescriptions filled, depends on the aggregate attraction of all the drugs under the PBM's plan. Therefore, the branded drug manufacturers involuntarily cooperate in affecting the PBM's market size, while competing for the market shares under the PBM's plan, which leads to an intricate co\u2010opetition among the branded drug manufacturers. We characterize the PBM's optimal copayment and pricing decisions, and establish conditions for the equilibrium analysis of the price competition among the branded drug manufacturers.

When a deal is presented with a minimum purchase quantity or a minimum spending requirement, experimental studies have shown some consumers are induced to spend more in order to obtain a discount. To study this behavior, we model a market in which consumers can be heterogeneous in two dimensions: willingness to pay for the product and deal proneness to a price discount. We examine two types of conditional promotions that are widely used in practice: (i) all\u2010unit discount, in which a price reduction applies to every unit of a purchase once the minimum requirement is met, and (ii) fixed\u2010amount discount, in which a fixed amount of discount is awarded to the total expense that meets the requirement. We show that deal\u2010prone consumers may be induced to overspend when offered a conditional discount. However, consumer overspending benefits the seller only when the market contains a sufficiently large proportion of highly deal\u2010prone or high\u2010valuation consumers. Comparing the two types of discounts, we show that the all\u2010unit discount outperforms the fixed\u2010amount discount when the regular price for the product is high, whereas the fixed\u2010amount discount is more profitable than the all\u2010unit discount when some consumers would make a purchase even without a discount.

In period 2, newcomers who wish to buy the new version arrive in the market.

This finding underscores the importance of choosing a rollover strategy. Interestingly and differently from the existing literature, we see that strategic waiting behavior can accelerate innovation.

Specifically, we incorporate two behavioral factors into multi\u2010server analytical queueing models: (1) server speedup due to increase of workload, and (2) server slowdown due to social loafing when multiple workers share the workload. We evaluate how these factors affect the performance of both the multi\u2010server single\u2010queue (SQ) and multi\u2010server parallel\u2010queue (PQ) system and the relative superiority of each system with respect to the number of customers in queue and the expected wait time in queue.

The direct effect leads to a reduced queue size due to increased expected service rate, while the indirect effect decreases queue size due to the \u201csmoothing\u201d effect. We quantify the performance impacts associated with both behavioral factors, illustrate the conditions where each effect dominates, and derive threshold values for these behavioral effects beyond which PQ systems outperform SQ systems.

This study examines how consumers evaluate remanufactured products when there are multiple conditions and generations of the item available, and evaluates the risk that remanufactured products pose to new product sales. We leverage transaction data of iPad sales from eBay and structural estimation techniques developed in the industrial organization literature to conduct our analysis. We find that product generation, condition, and seller attributes are all highly influential in shaping consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions and that the relationship between new and remanufactured products is much more nuanced and context\u2010specific than previously shown. Counter to industry intuition, we find that remanufactured products pose the same amount of threat to new\u2010condition goods as do used goods. Through these and other findings, we provide insights on how CLSC participants and those exploring entry into the remanufacturing business may achieve more profitable remanufacturing strategies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12884","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['remanufactured', 'consumers', 'purchasing decisions']","The article focuses primarily on consumer behavior and product sales without addressing social justice or ethical implications.

Recently, these retailers have also started to serve as online marketplaces by providing a platform to directly connect sellers with buyers. Over and above re\u2010shaping the traditional e\u2010commerce market, conventional wisdom suggests that this new format will mitigate the double\u2010marginalization effect and benefit both the intermediary and suppliers through a revenue sharing scheme. However, we find that upstream competition between suppliers critically moderates this possibility. We also find that the interaction of order\u2010fulfillment costs and upstream competition intensity moderates the selection of an optimal mode for the intermediary. More specifically, when order\u2010fulfillment costs are large and when the supplier product offerings are similar (i.e., competition intensity is high), the pure reseller mode is the preferred choice; when order\u2010fulfillment costs are small and the supplier product offerings are highly differentiated (i.e., low competition intensity), the pure marketplace mode is the preferred choice. Finally, the hybrid mode is preferred when order\u2010fulfillment costs are moderate and suppliers\u2019 products are somewhat similar (i.e., competition intensity is moderate). The intuition behind these results hinges on the trade\u2010off between transfer of pricing rights and the responsibility for order fulfillment. Our findings not only complement the emerging online marketplace literature but also provide testable empirical questions concerning the relationship and magnitude of different factors steering the mode choice.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12885","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of e-commerce models and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

In this study, motivated by real\u2010world practices, we consider a luxury fashion firm serving a conspicuous market consisting of two groups of consumers who influence one another. We investigate the optimal customer portfolios and budget allocation problem using the mean\u2010variance (MV) framework. Under the basic model in which all budget must be spent, we identify different scenarios and propose an algorithm to construct the MV efficient frontier for each scenario. Interestingly, different from the classic investment portfolio problem, we reveal that: (i) not all budget allocations between the two groups of consumers are MV efficient, which means that the efficient frontier is not continuous; (ii) in the presence of social influence, diversification of customer portfolio does not always lead to a smaller variance, which counterintuitively means that focusing on a single consumer group can reduce risk. We also prove that to maximize expected profit, the optimal strategy is to allocate all advertising budget to one group of consumers only (i.e., a polarized strategy). We illustrate analytically, the importance of identifying the right scenario for budget planning. Finally, we examine the budget saving strategy in the extended model and uncover that the respective range of efficient solutions is smaller than the one under the all budget spending strategy. This shows that the budget saving strategy offers less flexibility for MV efficient budget allocation than the all budget spending strategy.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12886","research article","POM","Operations Management","2","['social influence', 'consumer groups', 'budget allocation']","The article primarily focuses on optimizing advertising budgets in a luxury market context, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

The interplay between process flexibility and inventory is modeled as a two\u2010stage robust optimization problem. In the first stage, the firm allocates inventory before disruption happens; in the second stage, after a disruption happens, the firm determines production quantities at each plant to minimize demand loss. Our robust optimization model can be solved efficiently using constraint generation, and under some stylized assumptions, can be solved in closed form. For a canonical family of flexibility designs known as the K\u2010chains, we provide an analytical expression for the optimal inventory solution, which allows us to study the effectiveness of different degrees of flexibilities. Moreover, we find that firms should allocate more inventory to high variability products when its level of flexibility is low, but as flexibility increases, the inventory allocation pattern \u201cflips\u201d and firms should allocate more inventory to low variability products. These observations are further verified through a numerical case study of an automobile supply chain. Finally, we extend our robust optimization model to the time\u2010to\u2010survive metric, a metric that computes the longest time a supply chain can guarantee a predetermined service level under disruption.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12887","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain optimization and risk mitigation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A large part of the increase is attributable to sorting across lenders (55%-65%), and this, in turn, can be largely accounted for by the lender\u2019s ex post foreclosure risk. The remaining within-lender differences are also concentrated in high-risk lenders, revealing the central role of these institutions in explaining market-wide racial and ethnic differences.Received December, 17 2014; editorial decision January 20, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/1/175/3782656","articles","RFS","Finance","7","['racial differences', 'ethnic differences', 'high-cost mortgages', 'lenders']","The article addresses racial and ethnic disparities in high-cost mortgage lending, highlighting systemic issues within the lending practices of high-risk lenders.

In a neoclassical model of a firm with costly scale adjustment options, we show that the effect of scale flexibility (i.e., contraction and expansion options) is to determine the relation between risk and operating leverage: risk increases with operating leverage for inflexible firms, but decreases for flexible firms. Guided by theory, we construct easily reproducible proxies for inflexibility and operating leverage.

The scandal\u2019s disclosure lowered Andersen\u2019s clients\u2019 stock price sensitivity to monetary policy to about half that of other firms.Received February 12, 2016; editorial decision August 22, 2017 by Editor Robin Greenwood.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University PressWeb site next to the link to the final published paper online.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/10/3895/4161416","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial frictions and stock price reactions to monetary policy, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Evidence from Structural EstimationGet access","I study the driving forces behind dividend smoothing by developing a dynamic agency model in which dividends signal the earnings persistence of firms. In equilibrium, managers treat dividends and earnings as informational substitutes. They smooth dividends relative to earnings to smooth negative news releases and lower their turnover risk. Empirical estimates of the model parameters imply that 39% of observed dividend smoothness among U.S. firms is driven by managers\u2019 own career concerns, not shareholders\u2019 preferences. Managers cut investments and adjust external financing policies to accommodate this career-concern-based dividend smoothing.

Our novelty is that exchange rate growth need not equal the ratio of SDFs and that the SDF correlations are plausibly lowered.

Both the likelihood of forced CEO turnover and its sensitivity to performance increase. These effects are stronger for firms exposed to greater predation risk and with products more similar to those of other firms. CEOs are more likely to be forced out in weak governance firms; however, in good governance firms, CEOs are offered higher incentive pay. New outside CEOs receive higher incentive pay and come from firms with lower cost structures and higher asset sales.

Our estimates for 12,652 firms from 14 countries show that agency conflicts are large and highly variable across firms and countries. Differences in agency conflicts are largely due to differences in firm-level governance, ownership concentration, and other firm characteristics. The origin of law is more relevant for curtailing governance excesses than for guarding the typical firm. Agency costs split about equally between wealth transfers and value losses from policy distortions.

This assumption underlies the recovery result of Ross 2015. Following the methodology of Alvarez and Jermann 2005 and Hansen and Scheinkman 2009, we estimate the martingale component in the long-term factorization of the SDF using U.S. Treasury data. The empirically estimated martingale component is highly volatile and produces a downward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. In contrast, the transition independence assumption implies a degenerate martingale component and an upward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. Thus, transition independence is inconsistent with our empirical results.Received April 17, 2016; editorial decision January 17, 2018 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/12/4863/4962623","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bond markets and stochastic discount factors without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Deducing and Testing the Restrictions of the Recovery TheoremGet access","How reliable is the recovery theorem of Ross (2015)? We explore this question in the context of options on the 30-year Treasury bond futures, allowing us to deduce restrictions that link the physical and risk-neutral return distributions. Our empirical results undermine the implications of the recovery theorem. First, we reject an implicit assumption of the recovery theorem that the martingale component of the stochastic discount factor is identical to unity. Second, we consider the restrictions between the physical and risk-neutral return moments when the recovery theorem holds, and reject them in both forecasting regressions and generalized method of moments estimations.Received November 7, 2016; editorial decision July 24, 2017 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.

Taking Cues from Economic TheoryGet access","We study whether stocks are riskier or safer in the long run from the perspective of Bayesian investors who employ the long-run risk, habit formation, or prospect theory models to form prior beliefs about return dynamics. Economic theory delivers important guidance for long-run investment opportunities. Specifically, incorporating prior information from the habit formation or prospect theory models reinforces beliefs in mean reversion and inferences that stocks are safer over longer horizons. Conversely, investors with long-run risk priors perceive weaker mean reversion and riskier equities.

The first principal components of the equity volatility levels, skews, and term structures explain a substantial fraction of the cross-sectional variation. Furthermore, these principal components are highly correlated with the S&P 500 index option volatility, skew, and term structure, respectively. We develop an equity option valuation model that captures this factor structure. The model predicts that firms with higher market betas have higher implied volatilities, steeper moneyness slopes, and a term structure that covaries more with the market.

After the period of high growth, these banks have a lower return on assets and increase their loan loss reserves. The poorer performance of fast-growing banks is not explained by merger activity.

We find that implied prepayments are generally higher than actual prepayments, providing direct evidence of significant macroeconomic-driven prepayment risk premiums in mortgage-backed security prices.

We examine a unique data set of over 200,000 credit card mail solicitations to a representative sample of households and introduce credit card offers as a direct, informative measure of supply of such credit. Contrasting personal credit card offer dynamics before and after the passage of the CARD Act with those of personal loans, auto loans, and corporate credit cards, we find that lenders reduced credit supply of personal credit cards to nonprime borrowers in response to the CARD Act.

Banks most affected by the policy increase loan supply and lower interest rates on new mortgage originations. These lower-interest-rate loans serve as collateral for newly issued RMBS with lower-rated tranches and subsequently experience worse repayment performance. The performance deterioration is pronounced among loans with state guarantees, which suggests that looser collateral requirements may lead to undesired credit risk transfer to the sovereign.Received June 14, 2016; editorial decision September 8, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan.

Using data on union elections, we employ a regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of worker unionization on bondholders in bankruptcy states.

An increase in transparency through the staggered signing of bilateral tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) between home countries and tax havens is associated with a 2.5% increase in the value of affected firms. The results are stronger for firms with more complex tax haven structures and weakly governed firms. Furthermore, firms that respond to TIEAs by haven hopping (i.e., they move subsidiaries from affected to nonaffected tax havens) do not experience an increase in firm value. These results are consistent with tax havens being used for expropriation activities that extend beyond pure tax-saving activities.Received March 4, 2017; editorial decision October 5, 2017 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.

Although backfilling can be advantageous due to greater data coverage, if not addressed, the oversampling of firms with strong managerial incentives and higher subsequent returns leads to a significant upward bias in abnormal compensation, pay-for-performance sensitivity, and the magnitudes of several previously established relations. The bias also can lead to one misinterpreting the appropriate functional form of a relation and whether the data support one compensation theory over another.

We find that the closer directors of a board are to their next elections, the higher CEO turnover-performance sensitivity is. A series of tests, including one that exploits variation in Years-to-election that comes from other boards, supports a causal interpretation. Further analyses show that other governance mechanisms do not drive the relation between board Years-to-election and CEO turnover-performance sensitivity.

Aggregate excess foreign industry allocations are sizeable, on average amounting to over 100% for the largest domestic industries. While this foreign industry bias partly reflects familiarity-based motives, a large body of evidence on investment and performance patterns is, on the whole, remarkably consistent with a specialized learning motive contributing to the bias. This suggests that differences in industry structures across domestic stock markets proxy for international information asymmetries.Received January 14, 2015; editorial decision October 5, 2017 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.

This is consistent with theories in which default is costly because it disrupts financial intermediation and damages government reputation.

Returns for high reaching-for-yield funds nevertheless tend to be negative on a risk-adjusted basis.

Theoretical research suggests that money managers\u2019 short-term focus stems from their career concerns and greater fund transparency can amplify these concerns. Using a difference-in-differences design around a regulatory shock that increased the transparency of fund managers\u2019 portfolio choices, we examine whether increased transparency encourages myopic corporate investment behavior. We find that corporate innovation declines following the regulatory shock. Moreover, evidence from mutual fund trading behavior corroborates that the increased short-term focus of money managers drives the results.Received February 8, 2016; editorial decision August 31, 2017 by Editor Francesca Cornelli.

Uniform tick sizes constrain price competition and create rents for liquidity provision, particularly for securities with lower prices. The time priority rule allocates rents to high-frequency traders (HFTs) because of their speed advantage. An increase in relative tick size, defined as uniform tick sizes divided by security prices, increases the fraction of liquidity provided by HFTs but harms liquidity. We find that the message-to-trade ratio is a poor cross-sectional proxy for HFTs\u2019 liquidity provision: stocks with more liquidity provided by HFTs have lower message-to-trade ratios.Received September 15, 2015; editorial decision October 7, 2017 by Editor Robin Greenwood.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/6/2157/4975833","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of high-frequency trading and queue rationing under price controls, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Empirical relationships between parameter estimates and price impacts and between parameter estimates and stochastic volatility are consistent with theory. We illustrate how the estimates can be used to detect information events in the time series and to characterize the information content of prices in the cross-section.

We find evidence of informed trading before the announcements and a significant part of the news in announcements is impounded in stock prices before the announcements by pre-event informed trading. We also find evidence of informed trading after the announcements. Most strikingly, the probability of informed trading after merger bids predicts the probability of the bid being withdrawn or met with a competing bid.

We show that this learning exhibits complementarity: learning more along one dimension increases the value of learning about the other. As a result, regulatory changes may be counterproductive. First, increasing transparency (i.e., making fundamental information cheaper to acquire) can make prices less informative when investors respond by learning relatively more about others. Second, public disclosures discourage private learning about fundamentals, while encouraging information acquisition about others. Accordingly, disclosing more fundamental information can decrease overall informational efficiency by decreasing price informativeness.Received April 20, 2016; editorial decision September 30, 2017 by Editor Itay Goldstein.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/6/2377/4986470","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on financial transparency and its implications for market efficiency without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Firms that borrow from these banks have significantly lower investment. This is especially pronounced for firms that are more capital constrained or borrow from more-constrained banks. Various extensions and robustness analyses are consistent with the interpretation that commercial loans were crowded out by banks responding to profitable opportunities in mortgage lending, rather than with a demand-based interpretation.

Speculative-grade firms frequently refinance their corporate bonds early to extend maturity, particularly under accommodating credit supply conditions, leading to a procyclical maturity structure. In contrast, investment-grade firms do not manage their maturity in the same manner. I exploit the protection period of callable bonds to show that the maturity extension is not driven by unobservable confounding factors. The evidence is consistent with speculative-grade firms dynamically managing maturity to mitigate refinancing risk.Received June 6, 2016; editorial decision September 21, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/31/8/3061/4460113","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt maturity management and refinancing in the corporate bond market without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We show that acquirers with low institutional ownership, high deal risk, and high agency costs are more likely to bypass shareholder voting. Such acquirers have lower announcement returns and make higher offers than those who do not. To avoid a shareholder vote, acquirers increase equity issuance and cut payouts to raise the portion of cash in mixed-payment deals. Employing a regression discontinuity design, we show a positive effect on acquirer announcement returns concentrated in acquirers with higher institutional ownership.

While most investors specialize in a single asset class, a handful of generalists gradually reallocate capital across markets. Upon the arrival of a large supply shock, prices of risk in the directly affected asset class become disconnected from those in others. Over the long run, capital flows cause prices of risk to become more closely aligned. While prices in the directly affected market initially overreact, prices in related markets may underreact.

In general, I show that the principal reduces the manager\u2019s temptation to behave myopically by reducing the likelihood of termination and deferring compensation.

We find that publications by company scientists have declined over time in a range of industries. We also find that the value attributable to scientific research has dropped, whereas the value attributable to technical knowledge (as measured by patents) has remained stable. These trends are unlikely to be driven principally by changes in publication practices. Furthermore, science continues to be useful as an input into innovation. Our evidence points to a reduction of the private benefits of internal research. Large firms still value the golden eggs of science (as reflected in patents), but seem to be increasingly unwilling to invest in the golden goose itself (the internal scientific capabilities).","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2693","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['science', 'corporate', 'innovation']","The article discusses trends in corporate R&D and the decline of scientific research without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

In this article, we develop a novel theoretical framework detailing what collective action problems and solutions arise in market formation and under what conditions. Our framework centers on the development of market infrastructure with three key factors that influence the nature and extent of collective action problems: perceived returns to contributions, excludability, and contribution substitutability. We apply our framework to diverse market formation contexts and derive a set of attendant propositions. Finally, we show how collective action problems and solutions evolve during market formation efforts and discuss how our framework contributes to strategic management, entrepreneurship, and organization literatures.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2694","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","4","['collective action', 'market formation', 'diverse']","The article discusses collective action and its role in market formation, which hints at social cooperation and inclusivity, but it does not explicitly focus on social justice or equity themes.

Using a network pluralism approach, we separate a firm\u2019s ego alliance network into two activity-based networks\u2014an exploratory network and an exploitative network\u2014based on the primary value chain activity involved in each alliance. We argue that the cohesion of exploratory or exploitative networks has an inverted U-shaped effect on the addition of new partners in the same activity-based network, and a positive effect on the addition of new partners in the other network. Results based on data from the biotechnology industry largely support our predictions with one exception.

In this study, we focus on a critical post-promotion circumstance: the board chair\u2013CEO relationship. Drawing on the gender stereotype literature, agency theory, and stewardship theory, we posit that firms appointing a female CEO are more likely to adopt a collaboration board chair orientation and less likely to adopt a control orientation. We further predict this effect is attenuated by female board representation. Using a sample of new S&P 1500 CEOs, we find support for our predictions regarding the collaboration orientation but not the control orientation.

Through real-world examples and prior empirical findings, it shows that many of the implicit assumptions of the framework are regularly violated in practice when actors simplify their complex realities into incomplete, inaccurate mental models. These violations lead to outcomes that are often contrary to the predictions of the classical framework. As initial steps toward developing a cognitively grounded theory of strategic interactions, the article characterizes the core components of strategic mental models that might form the foundation of such a theory and then lays out some open questions that this theory would need to address.

This paper unpacks relationships between divestitures and subsequent performance, focusing first on the moderating role of prior performance and then on mechanisms through which divestitures by higher- and lower-performing firms affect performance. The study suggests that divestitures can exacerbate weakness and reinforce strength: divestitures by lower performers improve profits but inhibit sales growth and tend to speed the firms\u2019 exits as independent actors; by contrast, higher-performing divesters invest in support of existing assets and gain new growth, while avoiding becoming acquisition targets.

We find that program participation is associated with an increased likelihood of subsequent entrepreneurship but that this is not uniform across participants; the estimated relationship between program participation and subsequent entrepreneurial activity is disproportionately lower for applicants with ex-ante resources and capabilities in entrepreneurship, measured by prior entrepreneurship experience. Moreover, we only observe this reduced impact of the program on subsequent entrepreneurial activity for participants that have prior experience in founding a technology company as opposed to other forms of entrepreneurial activity.

We argue that firms with non-market capabilities are insensitive to supranational institutional safeguards when choosing the location of their international investments. We show that supranational agreements between an investor's home and host nation, operationalized as bilateral investment treaties (BITs), increase the likelihood of investment, but there is substantial firm heterogeneity with respect to this relationship. Firms with various forms of non-market capabilities are not sensitive to BITs, whereas other firms are more likely to invest under BITs. We advance the understanding of how firm non-market capabilities can substitute for supranational institutional arrangements in addressing risks associated with host country institutional weaknesses.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2927","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['institutional safeguards', 'non-market capabilities', 'investment']","The article discusses institutional safeguards and firm capabilities in the context of international investments, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

We argue that compared to CEOs with longer career horizons, CEOs with shorter career horizons will be less inclined to make real options investments because they may not fully reap the rewards during their tenure. In addition, we argue that long-term incentives and institutional ownership will mitigate the relationship between CEOs\u2019 career horizons and real options investments.

Using a sample of 313 alliances of U.S. firms from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries from 1992 to 2010, we find that managerial incentives lead to managerial preference for relationally risky distant partners over existing and new close partners. Further, board monitoring encourages managers to pursue existing and distant partners over new close ones, choices aligned with shareholder interests. In addition, we find that board monitoring substitutes for managerial incentives in alliance partner choice.

Using hand-collected data on the activist campaigns that were launched against and the divestitures that were undertaken by Fortune 500 companies between 2007 and 2015, we find that activist-impelled divestitures are more positively associated with immediate and longer-term measures of shareholder value than comparable manager-led divestitures. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals.

We show that intermediaries can reduce new firm growth rates due to institutional conflict. To analyze this idea, we examine the setting of junior stock exchanges, which are commonly formed to facilitate entrepreneurial growth.

Using a sample of 208 U.S.-based corporate foundations from 1993 to 2008, we find that the foundations give more in countries with opaque institutional environments, but they do so through international intermediaries. They also give more when the funding firms have new entries in countries with weak institutions\u2014hence greater needs for the social license to operate\u2014or when their operations require stronger connections with local suppliers or customers.

Using detailed data on division manager compensation and divestiture activity, this study documents that firms are more likely to divest divisions when pay inequality among division managers is higher. To address potential bias in the measurement of pay inequality, we construct a \u201csynthetic\u201d measure that varies with regional and industry pay shocks that differentially affect division managers within firms. Post hoc analyses reveal that social comparison appears to explain, at least partially, the relationship between unequal pay and divestiture. These findings support the notion that pay inequality can be an important predictor of firm boundaries. More generally, they suggest that unequal pay may have significant strategic consequences as firms increasingly adopt performance-based compensation to motivate employees.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2933","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['pay inequality', 'divestiture', 'social comparison']","The article discusses pay inequality and its influence on corporate decisions, highlighting themes of social comparison and the strategic consequences of unequal pay.

We observe less entry with more demand variation, more entry of more flexible firms, and that more flexible firms are more likely to enter markets with greater variation in demand. Furthermore, we find that this relationship is especially strong when variation in demand is harder to predict, which suggests that strategic flexibility is most valuable in unpredictable turbulent environments.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2940","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic flexibility and market entry in the airline industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We argue that political uncertainty alters the relative bargaining power between acquiring versus target firms. The host country's political uncertainty makes the returns on cross-border acquisitions more unpredictable. Accordingly, foreign acquirers demand compensation for such uncertainty in negotiations, otherwise they will not consider their acquisitions profitable. Thus, when political uncertainty is high in the host country, ceteris paribus, foreign acquirers have greater bargaining power, which leads to more favorable outcomes for acquirers. Using national elections to measure political uncertainty, we find evidence strongly supporting our prediction. Target firms capture a smaller portion of the acquisition gains than do acquiring firms, when political uncertainty is high.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2944","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of bargaining outcomes in cross-border acquisitions influenced by political uncertainty, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Evidence from China","Research Summary: Departing from the extant literature, which assumes that firms pursue strong environmental performance as a differentiation strategy, we analyze the general relationship between firms\u2019 competitive strategy and their response to heightened market competition. We find that, using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms between 2000 and 2005, intensified market competition has an overall negative impact on firms\u2019 environmental performance. The negative impact is exacerbated in firms adopting a cost-leadership strategy, but is attenuated in those adopting a differentiation strategy.

Analyzing VC syndicates over a 33-year period, I find that firms\u2019 performance relative to historical and social aspirations acts as a switch in firms\u2019 behavior with respect to dual goals of cooperation and competition in syndicates with competitors. Competition among firms in a syndicate negatively affects the probability of an IPO, but syndicates composed of firms underperforming their aspirations have a better chance of an IPO than syndicates of firms outperforming their aspirations, ceteris paribus. This effect is stronger when firms\u2019 goals in a syndicate are symmetrical or when firms\u2019 motivations based on both historical and social aspirations are aligned.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2722","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['cooperation', 'competition', 'aspirations']","The article discusses cooperation and competition dynamics among venture capital firms, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Cooperative behavior leads to joint value creation that yields common benefits, while competitive behavior is linked with value appropriation resulting in private benefits. Differential benefits arise when partners extract private benefits. Yet, private benefit extraction depends on the associated reduction in the common benefit potential of the alliance. This paper demonstrates that differential benefits decrease as partners refrain from private benefit extraction when the common benefit potential is high and common benefits are equally distributed. Differential benefits increase when a partner holds dominant operational control under high levels of task interdependence.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2731","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['cooperative behavior', 'joint value creation', 'common benefits']","The article focuses primarily on competitive and cooperative behaviors in alliances, with an emphasis on value creation and distribution.

This is especially true in ecosystems, in which firms depend on one another to collectively provide components and create value for consumers. Through an in-depth multiple case study of five firms in the U.S. residential solar industry from 2007 to 2014, we induct a theoretical framework that explains how firms navigate nascent ecosystems over time. We identify three strategies, each with a distinct balance of cooperation and competition, as well as unique advantages, disadvantages, and required capabilities.

We posit that incumbents ally with entrants following a core-knowledge discontinuity when the appropriability regime is strong. When the appropriability regime is weak, incumbents are more likely to acquire entrants. We submit that the additional consideration of complementary-asset discontinuities reveals a more integrated theoretical model of competition and cooperation between incumbents and entrants. In particular, incumbents tend to cooperate among themselves following complementary-asset discontinuities, although we highlight theoretical nuances due to different appropriability regimes.

Indeed, viewed dynamically, factors that often lead to higher value creation\u2014informal trust, repeated ties, customized assets\u2014may also lead to diminished alliance performance. We highlight interdependence between the complementary resources of partners as the critical factor determining the pattern of alliance value creation, notably how quickly alliances generate value and how quickly they are likely to dissolve.

Analyzing the communication and voting behavior of 115 firms across three subcommittees of a computing industry technology standards-setting organization over 14\u2009years, we find that existing product-market positions influence how firms with highly overlapped technological resources differ in their interactions: when their product-markets are more competitive, they exhibit greater support for the emerging standard, as evidenced by positivity and certainty of interaction tone; but when they possess a broader array of complementary products, support is tempered. At the subcommittee level, after accounting for aggregate competitive tensions in prior interactions, heterogeneity in both firms\u2019 relational influence as well as their prior multiparty experience improve consensus.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2786","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['heterogeneity', 'cooperation', 'conflict']","The article discusses firm heterogeneity and cooperation in technology coordination, but it primarily focuses on competitive dynamics and technical interactions without a significant emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques, leading to a low woke score."],["2018","39","12","Werner Hoffmann,\u00a0\n                     Werner Hoffmann\n                     WU Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, AustriaSearch for more papers by this authorDovev Lavie,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Dovev Lavie\n                     \n                        dovev.lavie@unibocconi.it\n                     \n                     Management and Technology Department, Bocconi University, Milan, Italy\n                     Correspondence\n                     Dovev Lavie, Bocconi University, Via Roentgen 1, 20136 Milan MI, Italy.\n                     Email: dovev.lavie@unibocconi.itSearch for more papers by this authorJeffrey J.

We formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the option value of CVC and the decision to exercise the RO using a dyadic dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. Our findings suggest that the option value of CVC is higher for investors with weaker scientific capabilities; engaging the markets for technology in distant technological fields; and, when their innovation pipeline is tilted toward the late-stage development process.

The contingent effects of strategic orientation and pay system design on firm performance","Research Summary: This article extends prior research on the performance implications of the fit between a firm's strategic orientation and its pay system design. Whereas prior research has shown that matching the pay system design to the strategic orientation of the firm generally contributes to higher performance, most studies have examined the pay systems of the upper echelons and employees separately. Based on an analysis that accounts for both horizontal and vertical pay dispersion, we find that, whereas growth-oriented firms (prospectors) tend to benefit from high horizontal pay dispersion, efficiency-oriented firms (defenders) perform better with high vertical pay dispersion and low relative base pay. Overall, our findings contribute to an improved understanding of how to optimize the pay systems of firms with different strategic orientations.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2953","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of strategic orientation and pay system design without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Longitudinal analyses based on 717 family-owned Taiwanese public firms from 1997 to 2011 demonstrate a positive relationship between CEO turnover and poor firm financial performance (or CEO turnover-performance sensitivity). This positive relationship is stronger when non-family ownership is higher in the firms. Further, the positive effect of non-family ownership on CEO turnover-performance sensitivity is stronger when the lack of governance transparency or a higher deviation between control rights and cash flow rights enables entrenchment of families.

This study examines how heterogeneity across divisions affects knowledge sourcing by multidivisional firms. We argue that firms source more early-stage knowledge, whose market prospects are highly uncertain, for low-performing divisions; by remaining active in the relevant markets, firms keep the flexibility to tap favorable market opportunities should they arise in the future. In contrast, firms source more late-stage knowledge, whose market prospects are largely revealed, for high-performing divisions so as to maximize current returns. The intra-firm heterogeneity, in turn, explains inter-firm differences in knowledge sourcing. Data from the pharmaceutical industry support these arguments.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2956","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge sourcing', 'heterogeneity', 'divisions']","The article focuses primarily on knowledge sourcing and market performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, this decision places them in a rich versus king dilemma. If they choose to implement such mechanisms and secure the king position, they risk losing money at IPO. If they choose not to implement control-enhancing mechanisms and adopt the rich position they risk losing control over the firm. We investigate theoretically and empirically the outcomes of this dilemma in a multi-period setting (at IPO and post-IPO).

To answer this question, we study two important trade-offs. First, working with a team provides access to additional resources but also leads to increased coordination costs. Second, sharing the risks and costs of developing an idea necessitates sharing the potential rewards of a successful idea. We use unique data on idea generators and their submission of ideas to an innovation program in a large European company between 1996 and 2008 to show how the two different trade-offs affect the decision of idea generators to collaborate with a team.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2696","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['teamwork', 'collaboration', 'resources']","The article discusses teamwork and collaboration, which are relevant to organizational dynamics, but does not explicitly address social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Conventional wisdom in strategic management holds that such differences in managerial cognitions lead to higher-quality strategic decisions, and thus to enhanced firm performance. However, 4 decades of empirical research have not provided consistent findings or clear insights into the effects of strategic dissent. Hence, we analyze the relative validity of predictions about these effects from both social psychological theories of group behavior and information processing perspectives on decision-making.

China's government is a central actor in both stimulating economic activities and pursuing environmental protection. Drawing on panel data and in-depth interviews, we examined the influence of the Chinese state at multiple levels on the environmental actions of publicly listed firms. The results show that corporate environmental actions follow an inverted U-shape as control of environmental practices moves from the central government to the most decentral administrative level. This curvilinear relationship is positively moderated by the stringency of environmental regulation and negatively moderated by environmental monitoring capacity. We conclude that state influence on corporate environmental actions in China is multifaceted and subject to \u201cpolicy-policy decoupling.\u201d","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2714","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","6","['environmental protection', 'corporate environmental actions', 'regulation']","The article discusses the influence of government on corporate environmental actions, highlighting themes of environmental protection and regulation, which align with socially responsible practices.

We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director\u2019s qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board (\u201cboard undervaluation\u201d), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm\u2019s CEO).","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2716","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['justice', 'normative', 'turnover', 'undervaluation']","The article introduces 'justice-based legitimacy' as a normative institution, indicating a focus on fairness and equity in corporate governance.

This study explores how changing levels of uncertainty and competition affect interfirm ties of entrepreneurial firms as markets transition from nascent to growth stage. Tracing six entrepreneurial game publishers during the growth stage of the U.S. wireless gaming market, the findings reveal that in a growth stage market, as uncertainty decreases, certain ties of entrepreneurial firms are terminated. First, existing partners may cut ties and become competitors after entering the market directly. This is a \u201cwinner's curse\u201d as more successful firms are more likely to entice their partners to enter the market directly. Second, ties may be terminated as prominent firms that are \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with too many partners cut ties with low to mediocre performance, while their remaining partners enter a positive spiral of tie strength and performance. Finally, as uncertainty decreases, new firms may enter the market as competitors to prominent firms. While entrepreneurial firms with high- and low-performing ties to prominent partners may find ties with these new entrants attractive, those with mediocre ties to few prominent partners find this move too risky and wait for a first mover to legitimate it. Overall, the findings show that changing levels of uncertainty and competition in growth stage markets can have different consequences for firms due to heterogeneity in their ties and power relative to partners. The findings provide several contributions to literature regarding the relationship among interfirm ties, firm performance, and market evolution.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2740","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['competition', 'interfirm ties', 'market growth']","The article primarily focuses on market dynamics and firm performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We find variation in relational or rivalrous competition by individual competitors across the phases of a micro-competition, between competitors within a micro-competition, and across multiple micro-competitions. These variations arise from the interplay between the unfolding competitive arena and the implementation of each firm's strategic portfolio. We develop a conceptual framework that makes four contributions to: relational competition; reconceptualizing action and response; elaborating on the awareness-motivation-capability framework within competitive dynamics; and the recursive dynamic by which implementing strategy inside firms shapes, and is shaped by, the competitive arena.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2724","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['competition', 'strategy', 'practices']","The article primarily focuses on competitive dynamics and strategy without a significant emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

In this methodological article, we explore and evaluate different ways of addressing this challenge. We draw on a corpus of qualitative process and practice studies to develop and illustrate three micro\u2013macro linking strategies associated with these perspectives: correlation, progression, and instantiation. The strengths and weaknesses of the different linking strategies are discussed, and opportunities for complementarity, combination, and development are proposed.

These visual mechanisms prompt meaning-making through the conversations they stimulate, creating strategic visibility. As participants react to visuals, they enact revised interpretations of the strategy, reflecting strategic resonance. Based on the interactions among these three subprocesses (visual mechanisms, strategic visibility, and strategic resonance), we develop a process model for how visuals influence meaning making in strategy engagements. We contribute to existing strategy practice and process studies by explaining how visuals help broker divergent interpretations of a strategy and give rise to new understandings, especially when issues are politically sensitive or analytically complex.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2727","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['meaning making', 'politically sensitive', 'divergent interpretations']","The article discusses how visuals can influence meaning-making in strategy, particularly in politically sensitive contexts, which hints at an awareness of social dynamics.

Whereas individual creativity thrives on novel combinations of diverse knowledge and perspectives, we argue that the characteristics of strategic decisions influence the extent to which employees\u2019 combinatory activities enhance their creativity. Multilevel modeling results based on 638 employees from 34 organizations show that the positive relationship between tertius iungens (TI) orientation and creative performance is reinforced by strategic decision comprehensiveness, especially when coupled with low strategic decision speed.

We identified two practices that contributed to integration failure. First, the practice of masking negative emotions caused members of both firms to perceive that the partner firm's members were satisfied with the integration process, even though they were not. These false perceptions of satisfaction resulted in minimal corrective actions, the escalation of the situation, and ultimately, integration failure. Second, efficiency-driven communication practices used in inter-firm communication exacerbated the effect of masking negative emotions on false perceptions of satisfaction by shielding both firms\u2019 members from the other firm's members\u2019 spontaneous emotional reactions.

Recent research suggests that social media may promote knowledge sharing because they allow social lubrication and the formation of trust. Our longitudinal and comparative analysis of social media usage at two large firms indicates that users who participate in nonwork interactions on social media catalyze a cycle of curiosity and passable trust that enables them to connect and share knowledge. Paradoxically, the very nonwork-related content that attracts users to social media and shapes passable trust can become a source of tension, thwarting a firm's ability to encapsulate knowledge in the form of routines and to use it to enact its strategy.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2739","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['trust', 'knowledge sharing', 'social media']","The article discusses knowledge sharing and trust in the context of social media, which touches on collaborative and inclusive practices.

We examine investor reactions to firms from 27 countries over 17\u2009years that are added, deleted, or continue on the index. We find that once relevant controls and comparisons to observationally equivalent firms beyond the index are included, DJSI events have only limited significance and/or materiality. Nonetheless, investors' valuation of sustainability around the world has evolved over time, involving diminishing reactions to U.S. firms and increasing benefits, particularly of continuation on the index, over time.

CEOs of restating firms add more new foundation board ties than CEOs of non-restating firms, while existing corporate philanthropy and greater corporate reputation diminish this effect. We also find that new ties to foundations boards influences media tenor for restating firms more than it does for non-restating peers.

An attention-based view of innovation in social networks","Research Summary: This study introduces the notion of attention allocation in networks to argue that individuals with different types of network structure produce good ideas via different pathways. Using survey data on communication networks at a software company, we find that people with highly constrained networks generate good ideas by following a logic of interrogation, by which they focus their attention on information from a particular contact. Conversely, individuals with less constrained networks produce good ideas by following a logic of recombination, whereby they divide their attention to information coming from across multiple contacts. The results show that in highly constrained networks, interrogation is a more reliable pathway to good ideas than recombination.

This difference depends largely on whether independent directors are concerned more with their public reputation or with their prospects in the director labor market. The explanation for this difference depends on an assumption of information asymmetry, however. In the present study, we relax the assumption of information asymmetry to examine how boardroom transparency affects directors\u2019 monitoring behavior. Using a randomized experimental study of actual independent directors, we find that boardroom transparency amplifies the effect of directors\u2019 inclinations toward either active or passive monitoring, with directors inclined toward vigilant monitoring becoming even more vigilant, and directors inclined toward passive monitoring becoming even more passive.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2756","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['transparency', 'monitoring', 'corporate governance']","The article discusses boardroom transparency and its effects on director behavior, which touches on ethical governance practices.

To do so, we augment real option theory's focus on uncertain future asset values (prospective uncertainty) with feedback learning theory that considers uncertain current asset values (contemporaneous uncertainty). This enables us to incorporate behavioral bias in the feedback learning process underlying the option execution/termination decision. The resulting computational model suggests that firms that inappropriately account for contemporaneous uncertainty and are subject to learning biases may experience substantial downside risk in undertaking real options. Moreover, contrary to the standard option result, greater uncertainty may decrease option value, making commitment to an investment path more effective than remaining flexible.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2757","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['bias', 'learning', 'uncertainty']","The article discusses behavioral biases and their impact on decision-making in financial contexts, which touches on ethical considerations but lacks a strong focus on social justice or DEI themes.

We examine the extent of, and the reasons for, employee interest in such an initiative in a global management consulting firm. We find a large fraction of employees to be interested in participation in the initiative even when participation requires a personal sacrifice in the form of a salary cut. However, this interest is driven not just by prosocial motivation: Expectations regarding private benefits, such as improved career prospects from new skills acquired, also play a role.

We show that superior decision-making performance is associated with using semiautomatic Type 1 cognitive processes when faced with well-structured problems, and more deliberative Type 2 processes when faced with ill-structured problems. Our findings shed light on the individual-level mechanism behind organizational adaptation and complement recent work on strategic inertia. In addition, our findings extend management studies that have stressed the relevance of cognitive flexibility for responding to the demands of increasingly open, flexible, and rapidly changing organizations.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2774","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","['cognitive flexibility', 'decision-making', 'organizational adaptation']","The article focuses on cognitive processes and decision-making performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques of business practices.

Such undervaluation lets firms buy resources relatively cheaply, but it can also constrain resource deployment. This article shows that the option to redeploy a firm's resources to a new business can be undervalued in stock markets when investors face ambiguity about that option due to uniqueness of redeployment. The developed formal model derives conditions under which stock markets undervalue resources. Those conditions are summarized with an empirical operationalization that can be tested with a broad range of strategic implications. Besides, the model provides a more complete account of resource redeployability by demonstrating the redeployability paradox. The paradox highlights that some determinants of redeployability enhance undervaluation, while simultaneously increasing objective value of redeployable resources.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2775","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on stock market dynamics and resource management without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We revisit this assumption, which is premised on the logic that imitated practices act directly to make the imitator more similar to its target. This logic is incomplete because imitation also acts indirectly\u2014via its effect on an imitator's post-imitation experiential learning efforts through which it refines imitated practices and fills remaining knowledge gaps. We examine how an imitator's focus of attention during this post-imitation experiential learning process impacts performance heterogeneity.

In response, organizations prioritize interactions involving the star to simplify learning. This simplification, however, creates organizational myopia. We claim that a star\u2019s temporary absence helps the organization overcome myopia by triggering a search for new routines. When he returns, the organization may combine these new routines with pre-absence routines to improve teamwork and performance.

We argue that a combination of vigilant monitoring, high-powered incentives, patient capital, and business independence makes private equity firms uniquely suited to correcting underinvestment problems in public corporations, and that they will therefore systematically target divested businesses that are outside their parents\u2019 core area, whose rivals invest more in long-term strategic assets than their parents, and whose parents have weak managerial incentives both overall and at the divisional level.

Cognitive mechanisms driving incumbent firms\u2019 responses to low-price market entry strategies","Research Summary: Low-price market entries, aiming for rapid sales growth, tend to prompt strong competitive reactions. This research explores whether and how firms using low-price entry strategies can mitigate retaliatory incumbent reactions. An experiment with 656 managers shows that entrants can attenuate the strength of incumbents\u2019 responses by fostering perceptions of high aggressiveness or low commitment. Entrants may be able to accomplish this by adjusting their entry strategy to embed (subtle) cues of aggressiveness and (lack of) commitment.

We develop an alternative and more active view of the role of senior management in the opportunity formation process in which senior management intervenes in the entrepreneurial process to resolve coordination and collaboration problems across initiatives and decide on resource allocation. We proffer rival hypotheses concerning the effect of such senior management involvement in the entrepreneurial process. Specifically, we hypothesize that the positive relations between bottom-up initiative/employee diversity and opportunity formation are positively (negatively) moderated by such direct involvement by senior management. We examine these ideas using two matched data sources: a double-respondent survey of CEOs and HR managers and employer\u2013employee register data.

Economic gain can arise through innovation or when a superior firm displaces competitors. We provide a firm-level measurement framework to quantify economic gain and its distribution among stakeholders, including the firm's shareholders, employees, suppliers, and customers.

Received wisdom, in both management theory and practice, would suggest that a practice that lowers the life expectancy of adopting firms, over time, will vanish because it puts those firms at a competitive disadvantage. In this paper, I challenge this view. I develop a conceptual model that details how a practice that lowers the survival chances of adopting organizations may still spread and continue to exist across a population of firms. I propose that a combination of three basic conditions is sufficient to bring about this phenomenon: if the practice is somehow associated with success, if there exists causal ambiguity, and if the rate of its diffusion is high compared with the rate at which it accelerates firms\u2019 demise, the practice may continue to thrive and become a widespread and persistent feature in an industry.

We explain how attention structure\u2014specialized attention within a particular unit and integrated attention between units\u2014affects both bottom-up (stimulus-driven) and top-down (schema-driven) attentional processing of new issues. We also examine the relationship between attention structure and divisional interdependencies, identifying conditions under which different attentional patterns generate organizational tensions that lead to architectural elaboration: the delineation of new organizational units. This logic is illustrated with examples from Motorola, a large telecommunications equipment provider, during a period of sustained growth.

I show that one intermediate measure, transaction surplus superiority (TSS), potentially solves both problems. Critically, TSS is defined independently of prices and its usefulness is independent of the degree of price competition: In \u201ccanonical\u201d market segments, firms with TSS always make superior segment profits (gross of sunk investments) compared to rivals. When combined with a restriction to \u201cincentive-compatible pricing behavior,\u201d TSS limits or solves the theoretical problem of indeterminate rivalry among oligopolists. Finally, TSS allows precise explanation of when sunk investments to improve efficiency are stimulated or suppressed by the \u201cspur of competition.\u201d","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2769","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive advantage and transaction surplus superiority without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

First, is the creation of more economic value. This tends to blunt competition and lowers minimum guaranteed profit. Second, is the potential generation of new productive alternatives for the incumbent, thereby inducing the opposite effect. We describe whether entry allows guaranteed profits to persist or creates guaranteed profits when they did not previously exist. We show that knowing that the entrant can replace the incumbent is not enough to determine the impact of entry on guaranteed minimum profits.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2770","special issue articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the economic implications of new entrants in a market context without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our findings suggest that appointing a family firstborn sibling is more likely when there is a high degree of SEW endowment and the family firm has pre-succession performance below aspiration levels.

This study examines the macro-structural contingencies that influence the marginal value of firm status as firms expand to new markets. Building on the literatures on status and social approval assets, as well as globalization and international management, we hypothesize that two conditions influence how valuable home-country status will be in a given host country: the interconnectedness of the home and host countries, and their relative position in the global network.

First, we show that liberalization policies increase state-level patenting, while the anti-liberalization policy reduces patenting. Next, we examine three possible mechanisms that could explain the findings. The results suggest that liberalization policies can increase the collaboration diversity of inventors, and hence, the rate, novelty, and impact of their innovation output, through promoting more liberal views and more openness to diversity. We also find speculative evidence that social liberalization policies increase entrepreneurial entry through promoting more diverse social interactions.

This subject is particularly important in a country like India where a multitude of religions, castes, and communities form its social fabric. We test for the role of homophily in professional CEO appointments in India by empirically examining the preference for same caste/religion CEOs by the largest firms. Using a unique dataset, assembled by detailed identification of castes/religions from family names and counterfactuals obtained through the Coarsened Exact Matching technique, we find that caste/religion plays a crucial role in CEO selection as a source of information (positive discrimination).

We distinguish between upstream and downstream relational capital and theorize that higher levels of specialization will buffer against decreases in upstream relational capital, because of deeper domain expertise and stronger downstream relational capital. Conversely, higher levels of generalization permit greater gains from increases in upstream relational capital, due to leverage across a more diversified downstream portfolio of activities. We test and find support for these hypotheses in the context of the US lobbying industry.

These administrative controls can take the form of board-like joint committees having explicitly delineated authority over certain alliance activities. We illuminate governing committees as an important, albeit neglected, instrument for administrative control in the governance of non-equity alliances, and we demonstrate that these organizational mechanisms facilitate knowledge flows within the scope of an alliance. We also show that governing committees safeguard against misappropriation hazards, particularly when a partner possesses the incentive and ability to engage in such behavior. This study extends alliance governance research beyond the implications of the equity-nonequity dichotomy to consider a wider and richer gamut of governance instruments available to address the challenges associated with knowledge transfers in alliances.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2898","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['knowledge sharing', 'governance', 'administrative controls']","The article focuses on governance mechanisms in R&D collaborations but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity themes.

Our starting point is that among firm hires, individuals with university research experience\u2014hired from universities or firms\u2014can be particularly valuable. However, conflicting institutional logics between academia and industry makes working with academic scientists challenging at times for firms. We suggest two solutions to this difficulty: hiring \u201cambidextrous\u201d individuals with a mix of experience of university research and working for a technologically advanced firm, and a strong organizational research culture in the recruiting firm reflected by the presence of a scientist on the top management team.

Such \u201cadverse competitor replacement\u201d reduces the profit of the superior incumbent and may even, in an extreme case, cause the superior incumbent to be driven from the market as well.

Yet, due to their lack of legitimacy, entrepreneurial firms find it challenging to engage in alliances. Thus, it is important to examine which factors may drive alliance formation for entrepreneurial firms. We examine whether the presence of venture capitalists (VCs) is such a factor. Whereas current research suffers from endogeneity concerns that make the comparison of VC- and non-VC-backed firms problematic, our empirical design reduces this problem. Overall, we find that the presence of a VC and a VC's experience with taking firms public are positively associated with entrepreneurial firms\u2019 alliance formation, and that VCs are more active in forming an alliance when the exit outcome is an acquisition, rather than going public.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2912","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of venture capital and alliance formation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We further posit that this relationship will be moderated by the level of firm risk. Our results support our hypotheses and, thus, offer important insights to the impression management literature.

More specifically, language concreteness is a key language attribute that generally induces positive investor responses.

We argue that firms seek partners that are similar in domain knowledge to deepen their knowledge, and partners that are dissimilar in architectural knowledge to broaden their knowledge. Our results indicate that the likelihood of alliance formation increases when two firms are similar in domain knowledge and dissimilar in architectural knowledge.

Thus, one disturbing trend that may explain stagnant growth is a 65% decline in firms\u2019 R&D productivity. We propose that the rise of outside Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) may be partially responsible for the decline because those CEOs are more likely to lack technological domain expertise necessary to manage R&D effectively. While this proposition was motivated by interviews with Chief Technology Officers (CTOs), we test it at large scale. We find that firm R&D productivity decays during the tenure of outside CEOs relative to that of inside CEOs. We further find this effect is more pronounced for firms with high R&D intensity and for firms employing outside CEOs with more remote experience, lending circumstantial support for the underlying assumption regarding lack of expertise.

We employ the estimates to simulate various hypothetical market structures to evaluate the profitability, welfare, and competitive effects of suites under alternative correlation assumptions.

We complement this literature by considering when and why ecosystems emerge, and what makes them distinct from other governance forms. We argue that modularity enables ecosystem emergence as it allows a set of distinct yet interdependent organizations to coordinate without full hierarchical fiat. We show how ecosystems address multilateral dependences based on various types of complementarities\u2014supermodular or unique, unidirectional or bidirectional\u2014which determine the ecosystem's value-add. We argue that at the core of ecosystems lie nongeneric complementarities, and the creation of sets of roles that face similar rules. We conclude with implications for mainstream strategy and suggestions for future research.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2904","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","2","[]","The article primarily focuses on the operational aspects of ecosystems in strategy research without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Empirically, we demonstrate that when cross-industry frictions in the form of limited skill transferability and within-industry frictions in the form of noncompete enforceability are both present, employees exhibit longer tenures, firms hire workers with less initial experience, firms change the amount and nature of training provided, and wages marginally increase.

Firms can neutralize the negative effect from this political rivalry by using direct or indirect connections to a constraining government with power over the focal government.

The replication is robust to the inclusion of additional controls. As in the original, tests of whether the theory is most powerful under higher uncertainty are not supported. Further, placing second, third, or merely participating in races also negatively predicts firm failure, and there is insufficient information in the data to tease out the importance of these predictors versus race victories.

In the context of the high-end fashion industry, we find that a subsidiary's creativity increases when it joins a conglomerate with either very low or high creativity. We interpret this as an imprinting effect of the environment inside a conglomerate on how effectively a subsidiary is integrated. Furthermore, over time, the creativity of a subsidiary increases with the creativity of other subsidiaries.

Second, is the power of modularity robust in nonmodular problems? We replicate and then reconcile the key results in two prior models on modularity: E&L and S-search. Our results yield several important insights. First, a significant portion of the advantage enjoyed by S-search is attributed to multi-bit mutation. Second, organization-evaluation needs to be used in combination with multi-bit mutation.

A common tool of empowering minority shareholders is to curb controlling shareholders\u2019 power of expropriating firm value, but this approach was rarely successful because of the resistance from powerful controlling shareholders. We examine an alternative way of empowering minority shareholders without directly fighting with controlling shareholders. A major corporate governance reform in China gave minority shareholders a decision right over certain actions that affected the creation of firm value. We demonstrate that the greater the extent to which minority shareholders\u2019 actions can influence the firm's value ex post, the more value controlling shareholders concede to minority shareholders ex ante. This effect becomes even stronger when controlling shareholders are able to expropriate a larger portion of firm value.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2921","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","5","['minority shareholders', 'corporate governance', 'empowering']","The article discusses the empowerment of minority shareholders, which aligns with themes of equity and representation in corporate governance.

The role of character questioning causal accounts and executive capital in dismissed CEO reemployment","Research Summary: Despite the prevalence of CEO dismissal, theory only briefly explores its consequences. Past research indicates few fired CEOs regain employment. We suggest dismissal stigmatizes executives; however, stigmatization is greatest when character questioning causal accounts exist, which affect the likelihood of regaining a CEO position. Furthermore, we argue that reputational and social capital provide signals of executive quality that moderate the level of stigmatization experienced when character questioning causal accounts exist. Following 280 dismissed CEOs, we find that social capital increases the likelihood of rehiring for those with character questioning causal accounts, but negatively impacts those without causal accounts. Alternatively, we find reputational capital positively influences those without causal accounts, while having a slight negative relationship for those with causal accounts.","https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2922","research articles","SMJ","Management & Organizations","3","['stigmatization', 'character questioning', 'social capital']","The article discusses the stigmatization of dismissed CEOs and the impact of social capital on their reemployment, which touches on themes of reputation and social dynamics.

Termination refers to the abandonment of inventive efforts that are no longer deemed promising. We argue that high interdependencies between an inventive effort and the other inventions in the same research program will increase the cognitive burden on managers and decrease the likelihood of termination. Further, in the presence of interdependencies, managers are likely to rely on heuristics for termination decisions. We focus on two such heuristics: interdependencies of an invention with those in other research programs and the level of external competition in the research program.

In the U.S., in contrast, the regulator decided against such rotation. Whereas proponents argue that rotation would strengthen independence and decrease audit market concentration, opponents stress the importance of auditors' learning effects, which would be eliminated by a change in auditors. In extending the market matching model of Salop (1979), we provide an analysis that integrates these contradictory views. We assume that both auditors' industry expertise and their experience in auditing a client decrease audit costs. We investigate the bidding strategies applied to re-acquire clients that were lost due to rotation, auditors' profit contributions, the equilibrium number of auditors (i.e., audit market concentration), and the economic importance of specific clients. Our findings indicate that the regulators' goals of simultaneously decreasing client importance and audit market concentration are in direct conflict and, therefore, the rotation system might have unintended consequences. Our model, thus, suggests how different institutional parameters give rise to economic forces that can support diverging decisions regarding the implementation of MAR.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/1/1/3943/The-Effects-of-Mandatory-Audit-Firm-Rotation-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of audit firm rotation and its economic implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In our setting, the Chinese government substituted economic value added (EVA) for return on equity (ROE) in the performance score formula it uses to evaluate State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). In accordance with the Chinese government's objective to increase the capital efficiency of SOEs, supervisors shifted the weight in subjective adjustment decisions from ROE to EVA after EVA adoption. Consistent with EVA adoption creating fairness concerns, however, supervisors did not penalize SOEs for performing poorly on EVA when they performed well on ROE, and accomplished this by shifting the weight from EVA back to ROE. Additional analyses suggest that personal preferences motivated supervisors to make these lenient subjective adjustments. Overall, our findings indicate that adopting new performance measures creates fairness concerns that motivate supervisors to consider their personal preferences in subjective adjustment decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/1/161/3934/How-Adopting-New-Performance-Measures-Affects","articles","TAR","Accounting","5","['fairness', 'subjective adjustments', 'performance measures']","The article discusses fairness concerns related to performance evaluations, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations within the accounting field.

We investigate whether differences in the predictive value are attributable to differences in recognition or measurement, providing evidence suggesting that impairment recognition under U.S. GAAP is delayed. Evidence also suggests that the value-in-use measurement attribute, allowed under IFRS, does not induce under-impairing as IFRS and U.S. GAAP impairments are similarly related to future impairments.

Although all conditions require knowledge sharing to maximize payoffs, our results suggest that significantly more knowledge is shared under group incentives relative to individual incentives when status differences are present, whereas the amount of knowledge shared does not differ across these incentive manipulations for equal-status groups. These findings are in line with theory suggesting that individual incentives can motivate knowledge sharing among equal-status groups, but cannot overcome the negative interactions that arise under status differences. Instead, group incentives are required to induce cooperative behavior that mitigates the negative effects of status differences on knowledge sharing.

We argue that acquirers with low-quality internal information needed to select profitable acquisitions will make poorer acquisition decisions. We also argue that ICWs impede effective monitoring and are likely to hinder integration tasks that are important to acquisition profitability. We find that ICWs disclosed prior to an acquisition announcement predict significantly lower post-acquisition operating performance and abnormal stock returns. Poorer post-acquisition performance is concentrated in ICWs that are expected to impede acquisition activities (i.e., forecasting/valuation, monitoring, and integration).

The preparation and disclosure of more accounting items is complicated because it requires greater knowledge of authoritative accounting standards. This aspect of complexity can increase the likelihood of mistakes, incorrect application of GAAP, and can ultimately lead to less credible financial reports. Consistently, we find that ARC is associated with a greater likelihood of misstatements and material weakness disclosures, longer audit delay, and higher audit fees. In comparison to commonly used measures of operating and linguistic complexity, the associations between ARC and these outcomes are more consistent, exhibit greater explanatory power, and have stronger economic significance. These and additional validation and robustness tests suggest that ARC more completely reflects accounting complexity. In addition, ARC exhibits several advantageous properties, including across- and within-firm variation, availability for the universe of SEC filers, and a direct connection to accounting, inherent in its derivation from detailed accounting disclosures. Finally, because it relies on a comprehensive set of detailed accounting data, ARC broadly captures accounting complexity, while, at the same time, it can be disaggregated into account-specific measures of complexity.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/1/259/3936/Measuring-Accounting-Reporting-Complexity-with","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting reporting complexity without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Results of a laboratory experiment demonstrate that providing both an input and an output target on the routine task leads to greater creative task performance relative to providing one or none of these targets. This result is consistent with theory suggesting that individuals need guidance as to how much routine work to complete in order to achieve the cognitive closure necessary for them to think creatively. However, individuals also need guidance that encourages them to limit time on their relatively comfortable routine work and spend time on more open-ended creative endeavors. By setting expectations as to what employees need to achieve on their more routine day-to-day responsibilities, organizations can increase the efficacy of the growing practice of allowing employees to spend a portion of their work week on creative endeavors.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/1/29/3917/The-Effect-of-Input-and-Output-Targets-for-Routine","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['creative', 'routine tasks', 'performance']","The article focuses on the relationship between task management and creative performance without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

When investors are uncertain about the credibility of the reporting process, earnings response coefficients, as well as market-to-book values (MTB), are random and time-varying; relatively low MTB reflect poor credibility of financial reporting; stock prices are s-shaped in earnings surprises and relatively insensitive to bad news. Finally, when the manager is more likely to have reporting discretion, discretionary accruals tend to be larger and more volatile. We estimate the model using U.S. earnings announcement data during 2002\u20132012 and find that the probability of misreporting is 7 percent.

I examine this possibility using Burgstahler and Dichev's (1997) theoretical framework. They argue that the relative importance of earnings and book value depends on expected adaptation, which is the likelihood that the existing earnings generating process will be altered. Using restructuring costs to proxy for expected adaptation at the individual acquirer level, I find that the association between the target's earnings (book value) and acquirers' bid prices is decreasing (increasing) in expected adaptation, consistent with theoretical predictions.

When analysts do not ask about prior guidance, managers are less likely to provide that type of guidance in the future. This effect is long-lasting, spills over into earnings announcements, and is strongest for firms with the most severe information problems.

We develop a novel measure to capture IIA between divisional managers and top corporate managers, computed as the difference in their respective trading profits on their own company's stock (DIFRET). Numerous validation tests indicate that DIFRET indeed captures the information asymmetry between divisional managers and top managers. In our primary tests, we find that DIFRET is associated negatively with the accuracy, bias, specificity, and frequency of management forecasts. Furthermore, the likelihood of error-driven accounting restatements increases with DIFRET. Our results, thus, suggest that external communication quality suffers when the information asymmetry between divisional managers and top managers is more severe.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/1/71/3927/Clarity-Begins-at-Home-Internal-Information","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['information asymmetry', 'management forecasts', 'financial statements']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of internal information asymmetry and its impact on financial reporting, with no significant emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We draw on both economic and behavioral theories to predict that communication content, even though subjective, provides information that enables the manager to allocate bonuses so as to enhance the relation between individuals' contributions and rewards, thereby increasing individuals' effort and team performance. However, we also predict that the positive effect of team member subjective communication is more muted when team members' abilities are heterogeneous compared to homogeneous. We test these predictions via an experiment. Consistent with our predictions, team member subjective communication has a positive effect on team performance, and the positive effect is more muted for heterogeneous teams. Results of our study contribute to both theory and practice by enhancing our understanding of the role of subjective communication from team members to team managers in motivating effort in teams and, particularly, how its efficacy is affected by team composition.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/1/3997/Team-Member-Subjective-Communication-in","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['communication', 'team performance', 'heterogeneous', 'homogeneous']","The article discusses team dynamics and communication but primarily focuses on performance metrics rather than social justice or equity themes.

The fair value estimation process is subject to verifiability concerns when market prices are unavailable and, thus, susceptible to managerial discretion. We explore whether banks' exposure to less-verifiable fair value estimates is associated with conditional conservatism. General and bank-specific conservatism measures indicate that banks with greater proportions of less-verifiable fair value assets exhibit more conditional conservatism. Cross-sectional analyses provide evidence that this relation varies predictably with investor-demand and manager-supply proxies. Further analyses indicate that monitoring institutional investors drive the demand for conservatism. We identify high-quality auditors and board independence as two mechanisms used to invoke conservatism. Findings are robust to the exclusion of fair value earnings components, suggesting that the effect is not confined to fair value accounts. Together, our results indicate that less-verifiable fair value estimates generate demand for conditional conservatism in the financial industry.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/119/4061/The-Association-between-SFAS-No-157-Fair-Value","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['conditional conservatism', 'fair value', 'managerial discretion']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and does not emphasize social justice or ethical critiques.

However, based on Correspondent Inference Theory, we predict and find that when management uses REM, auditors are more restrictive of management's subjective estimates, making it more difficult for management to use income-increasing AEM. Our experiment manipulates the presence versus absence of REM, and whether the audit difference potentially impacts the client's ability to meet an earnings target. Using a serial mediation model, we find that when auditors observe REM, they perceive these operating decisions as aggressive, leading them to perceive management as aggressive, ultimately causing greater proposed adjustments on an unrelated audit difference. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating that when auditors observe REM, their altered perceptions about management can cascade, affecting how they respond to management estimates in unrelated financial statement accounts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/145/4040/The-Effect-of-Real-Earnings-Management-on-Auditor","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management and auditor behavior without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Dechow et al. (1998) also suggest that the strength of the relation between accruals and revenue changes relates to operating cycle length. Prior accrual models have not incorporated these theoretical relations. We show that incorporating cash-flow changes, serial correlation in cash-flow changes, and operating cycle length increases explanatory power of all accrual models considered (i.e., Jones 1991; Ball and Shivakumar 2006; McNichols 2002; Jeter and Shivakumar 1999).

We hypothesize that private information obtained from borrowers' major customers can facilitate more timely and precise evaluation of borrowers' creditworthiness; this potentially reduces supply-chain lenders' reliance on accounting conservatism in debt contracting. Consistently, we find that suppliers borrowing from supply-chain lenders provide less conservative financial statements than suppliers borrowing from non-supply-chain lenders at loan origination. This finding is more pronounced when supply-chain lenders are likely to have greater information advantage over non-supply-chain lenders. Based on latent factors that proxy for private information accessible from customers, we find that supply-chain lenders' information advantage relates to customers' future operational and financial risks. Further, in lending agreements, supply-chain lenders accept fewer accounting-based contractual terms, lower spreads, and longer loan maturity than non-supply-chain lenders. The overall evidence suggests that borrowers' major customers represent an important information channel that enables lenders to more effectively screen and monitor borrowers, thus weakening the debt contracting demand for accounting conservatism.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/187/4005/Lenders-Experience-with-Borrowers-Major-Customers","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt contracting and accounting conservatism without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We survey the use of contrast analysis in the recent literature and propose a three-part testing approach that provides a more comprehensive picture of contrast results. Our approach considers three pieces of complementary evidence: the visual evaluation of fit, traditional significance testing, and quantitative evaluation of the contrast variance residual. Our measure of the contrast variance residual, q2, is proposed for the first time in this work. After proposing our approach, we walk through six common contrast testing scenarios where current practices may fall short and our approach may guide researchers.

ExpectedRCL substantially outperforms net charge-offs in predicting one-year-ahead realized credit losses, and reflects nearly all the credit loss-related information in the charge-offs. ExpectedRCL also contains incremental information about one-year-ahead realized credit losses relative to the allowance and provision for loan losses and the fair value of loans.

An experiment with 101 experienced auditors shows that LM decomposition leads auditors to be less concerned about high-risk fraud schemes relative to auditors who make holistic risk assessments. Our analyses also show that, relative to those making holistic risk assessments, the correlation between auditors' likelihood judgments and their overall fraud risk judgments and the coherence of their fraud risk judgments are higher for auditors who perform an LM decomposition. Two follow-up experiments with students replicate these findings for higher-risk events, and (unlike the auditor experiment) we also find that LM decomposition results in lower risk judgments for lower-risk issues. We also find that LM decomposition mitigates the influence of affective responses on high-risk judgments.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/273/4026/The-Influence-of-Judgment-Decomposition-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditing and risk assessment without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This association is stronger when managers have discretion to coordinate cross-border transactions internally and when they do not face political costs imposed by labor unions. Following instances of offshoring, I find some evidence that offshoring firms have lower effective tax rates, but these reductions are concentrated within larger layoffs in which jobs are sent to low-tax countries.

Further, firms with CEOs who are more locked-in to their stock positions (i.e., CEOs with higher tax burdens) experience larger increases in risk-taking following federal and state tax cuts. When I investigate the mechanism behind this relation, I find that tax cuts trigger stock sales by the locked-in executives, allowing for improved diversification. Overall, my findings indicate that the personal tax burdens of CEOs affect the firm by reducing executives' preferences for risk at the corporate level.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/325/4086/Locked-In-The-Effect-of-CEOs-Capital-Gains-Taxes","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of CEO tax burdens and corporate risk-taking without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We interview 37 partners from 18 firms representing nine AANs to examine how small firms leverage their AAN membership and to understand the related implications for audit quality. Our findings indicate that small firms acquire needed resources and enhance their market legitimacy through AAN membership; however, the nature and extent to which they do so varies by AAN type. Importantly, we also find that the majority of respondents perceive AAN resources, especially access to expertise, as critical to their firms' audit quality.

Following the methodology of Dyreng, Hanlon, and Maydew (2010), we estimate managerial tax avoidance fixed effects and use these to identify tax rate shocks associated with executive turnover. We find that peer firms respond to these shocks by changing their GAAP tax rates in the same direction. The magnitude of the effect corresponds to an approximately 10 percent response to the average change in peer group GAAP ETR. Our evidence suggests that these peer effects occur only for book (i.e., financial reporting), rather than cash (i.e., real effects), ETR and are concentrated in firms with potentially greater discretion in reporting taxes on foreign earnings.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/5/97/4019/Taxes-and-Peer-Effects","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['tax behavior', 'financial reporting', 'peer effects']","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of tax behavior and financial reporting without any significant emphasis on social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

However, we consider the possibility that such knowledge and experience increase the likelihood of material misstatement when executives have incentives to misreport. We use executives' prior experience as an audit manager or partner as a measure of extensive accounting and financial reporting competence. We find that the interaction of this measure and compensation-based incentives increases the likelihood of misstatements. Further, auditors discount the audit fee premium associated with compensation-based incentives when executives have accounting competence. Together, our results suggest that a dark side of accounting competence emerges in the presence of certain incentives, but auditors view accounting competence favorably despite the heightened risk. In further analyses, we demonstrate that executives' aggressive attitude toward reporting exacerbates the effect of accounting competence and compensation-based incentives on misstatements, but not on audit fees.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/6/1/4046/Do-Auditors-Recognize-the-Potential-Dark-Side-of","articles","TAR","Accounting","3","['dark side', 'misstatement', 'incentives']","The article discusses the ethical implications of accounting competence and the potential for misstatements due to executive incentives, indicating a moderate engagement with ethical themes.

Our findings show that FVM of assets is associated with noticeably lower information asymmetry, and that this reduction is more than twice as large when banks also recognize OCR. In addition, we find that the bid-ask spread is incrementally lower for banks that provide more detailed narrative disclosures on OCR.

Multivariate logistical regression findings indicate that goodwill impairment incidence is negatively associated with economic performance, but also related to proxies for managerial and firm-level incentives. In addition, whereas goodwill impairment tends to be timely for firms in high enforcement countries, firms in low enforcement countries tend to be less responsive to declines in the economic value of goodwill; CEO compensation concerns affect the impairment decision for firms in low enforcement; and CEO reputation concerns and management preference for smooth earnings influence goodwill impairment decisions in high, as well as low, enforcement countries. We also find that private monitoring through institutional investors substitutes for public enforcement in the context of goodwill impairment when a country's enforcement regime is relatively weak.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/6/149/4121/Goodwill-Impairment-The-Effects-of-Public","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['enforcement', 'monitoring', 'institutional investors']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of goodwill impairment and the role of enforcement and monitoring by institutional investors, with no significant emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

In our first model, conservatism introduces downward bias in the first period; any understatement of first-period performance is reversed in the second period. A conservative bias is not costly in the first period but instead is costly in the second period when a new manager may be rewarded for the performance of his predecessor. In an extension on learning, we illustrate a beneficial role of conservatism in fine-tuning incentives. In the second model, conservatism is modeled as recognizing effort-independent bad news early and good news late. Recognizing bad news early can be optimal because of intertemporal rent shifting, which improves incentives via an \u201cincentive spillback.\u201d We also study overlapping projects (a multi-task setting) in which an interior accounting system can be optimal to avoid making one of the overlapping projects an incentive bottleneck.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/6/181/4072/Accounting-Conservatism-and-Incentives","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting conservatism and its impact on incentives without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Using a new measure, SALIENCE, defined as the number of quantitative items in an earnings press release headline, we find strong evidence consistent with salience effects. Higher SALIENCE is associated with stronger announcement reaction and subsequent PEAR. Managers are more likely to choose higher SALIENCE before selling shares in the post-announcement period and when earnings are high, but less persistent, and to choose lower SALIENCE before stock option grants. The results are robust to using residual salience and an extended set of control variables.

We examine this claim by comparing the value relevance of banks' financial statements under fair value accounting with that under current GAAP, which is largely based on historical costs. We find that the combined value relevance of book value of equity and income under fair value is less than that under GAAP. We also find that fair value income is less value-relevant than GAAP income because of the inclusion of transitory unrealized gains and losses in fair value income. More surprisingly, we find that book value of equity under fair value is not more value-relevant than under GAAP, due both to divergence between exit value and value-in-use and to measurement error in fair value estimates. Overall, our results suggest that financial statements under fair value accounting provide less relevant information for bank valuation than financial statements under current GAAP.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/6/257/4094/Does-Fair-Value-Accounting-Provide-More-Useful","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and financial statement relevance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Studies 2, 3, and 4 are experiments examining team leader reactions to speaking up, both at the time speaking up occurs (Study 2) and later, during performance evaluation (Studies 2, 3, and 4). Results provide evidence that team leaders react with irritation at the time speaking up occurs, particularly if a team member raises an audit effectiveness issue that could increase audit effort.

Prior theory and evidence suggest renegotiation considerations from coordination difficulties in large syndicates and intertemporal transfers due to relationship lending in small syndicates are factors in the design of covenants. I find that for large syndicates, borrowers and lenders avoid the use of flexibility-reducing covenants that are more likely to impact negatively on value-enhancing corporate policies in good states of the world. This effect becomes stronger when the borrower has fewer outside financing options. Additionally, I find contracts with large syndicates are more likely to have more covenant slack, include performance pricing provisions, have tailored capital expenditure covenants, and principally rely on covenants that are directly linked to the current performance of the borrower. Collectively, these results imply that syndicate size and related renegotiation considerations affect how accounting information is used in debt contracts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/6/301/4018/Syndicate-Size-and-the-Choice-of-Covenants-in-Debt","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of debt contracts and syndicate size without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Applying this theory, we conduct experiments to examine how the locus of breach (external versus internal) moderates the efficacy of management's responsibility acceptance (higher versus lower). Our results show that management's higher (versus lower) responsibility acceptance is a more effective strategy in the presence of an external breach, but not in the presence of an internal breach (Experiment 1).

Because of their greater prominence and visibility to market participants, more widely covered firms can pose greater reputational costs for rating agencies. Consistent with rating agencies limiting such risk, we find that ratings for more widely covered firms are more timely and accurate, downgraded earlier and systematically lower in the year prior to default, and better predictors of default and non-default. We also find that the recent tightening of credit rating standards is largely explained by growing business press coverage of public debt issuers. Additionally, we find that credit rating agencies take explicit actions to improve their ratings by assigning better educated and more experienced analysts to widely covered firms. Moreover, we document that missed defaults of more visible firms create greater negative economic consequences for rating agencies, and that rating improvements following the financial crisis were greater for more visible firms.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/93/6/61/4059/Are-Credit-Ratings-More-Rigorous-for-Widely","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of credit ratings and their relationship with business press coverage, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.
