This was an era characterized by a shift to active anti-trust policy, which manifested itself in legal action to disband a trust that had dominated the industry, the Motion Pictures Patents Corporation (MPPC). We use archival data to show that mortality was reduced by trust membership and increased with the market share of the trust members. The effects of litigation are varied, with litigation filed by trust members enhancing mortality and litigation filed against trust members decreasing mortality. Analysis of coded headlines from media reports on the emerging industry shows that a shift in the view of the trust in the normative environment toward a more negative view was also associated with decreased mortality. Results also show that learning and the compensatory fitness enjoyed before anti-trust law was enforced prevented the MPPC members from recognizing changes in the marketplace; as a result, they were less likely to move from making short films to making increasingly popular feature-length films.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2005.50.1.1","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","2","['anti-trust', 'legal environments', 'market control']","The article discusses anti-trust policies and their impact on market dynamics, but it does not emphasize social justice, equity, or diversity themes.

We analyze the discursive struggle that ensued between proponents and opponents of the new organizational form. We observe that such rhetorical strategies contain two elements. First are institutional vocabularies, or the use of identifying words and referential texts to expose contradictory institutional logics embedded in historical understandings of professionalism, one based on a trustee model and the other based on a model of expertise. A second element of rhetorical strategies is theorizations of change by which actors contest a proposed innovation against broad templates or scenarios of change. We identify five such theorizations of change (teleological, historical, cosmological, ontological, and value-based) and describe their characteristics.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2005.50.1.35","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['institutional change', 'professionalism', 'rhetorical strategies']","The article discusses institutional change and the rhetorical strategies involved, which touches on themes of professionalism and change but lacks a strong focus on social justice or equity.

We argue that several ambiguities in the resource dependence model account in part for this and propose a reformulation of resource dependence theory that addresses these ambiguities, yields novel predictions and findings, and reconciles them with seemingly contradictory empirical evidence from past studies. We identify two distinct theoretical dimensions of resource dependence, power imbalance and mutual dependence, which in the original theory were combined in the construct of interdependence and yet have opposite effects on an organization's ability to reduce dependencies by absorbing sources of external constraint. Results from a study of interindustry mergers and acquisitions among U.S. public companies in the period 1985\u20132000 indicate that, while mutual dependence is a key driver of mergers and acquisitions, power imbalance acts as an obstacle to their formation.

In an analysis of the independent-power sector of the electricity industry from 1980 to 1992, we found that the development of regulative and cognitive institutions legitimated the entire sector and provided incentives for all sector entrants; thus, foundings of all kinds of firms multiplied rapidly but had a stronger impact on those using risky novel technologies. In contrast, the central normative institutions that developed in this sector, state-level trade associations, provided greater support for particular forms (those using established technologies) and thus increased foundings of those favored forms more than foundings of less favored forms (those using novel technologies).

According to the concept of gender primacy, men would not enter a female-dominated occupation in large numbers because it is associated with gender essentialism. Hospital administration is one of the rare female occupations that did masculinize. Our analysis of archival texts on hospital administration in the early 1900s describes that in establishing a jurisdiction, body of knowledge, and educational requirements, the male-dominated professional association created a male sex boundary. Extracting and elaborating functions consistent with gender primacy and sloughing off functions associated with gender essentialism reframed the occupation as male. Rhetorical use of gender created a male image of the generic practitioner and the occupation, while an internal boundary segregated women within the occupation. The study points to differences in how occupations feminize and masculinize and suggests the latter does not occur solely in response to societal factors, as has been assumed, but can originate within the occupation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.2005.50.2.233","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","8","['gender', 'feminine', 'masculinize', 'gender essentialism', 'gender primacy']","The article explores the historical gender dynamics within a female-dominated occupation, focusing on how masculinization occurred and its implications for gender roles in professional settings.

Our theory suggests that under conditions of low performance, there may be a systematic tendency for outside directors to underestimate the extent to which fellow directors share their concerns about the viability of the firm's corporate strategy. This reduces the propensity for individual directors to express their concerns about the current corporate strategy in board meetings, decreasing the likelihood that boards will initiate strategic change in response to low firm performance. We also posit factors that may moderate the extent to which pluralistic ignorance occurs on boards. We suggest that demographic homogeneity among outside directors (with respect to gender, functional background, education, and industry of employment) and the density of friendship ties among them will significantly moderate the occurrence of pluralistic ignorance on boards. We test our hypotheses with original survey data from a large sample of outside directors at medium-sized U.S. companies and find support for our theory.

We propose that during market-oriented transition, family and prior social ties could improve group performance by providing informal norms that strengthen the intermediation within business groups and that family relationships could reduce strategic restructuring and generate performance benefits. Results of a longitudinal study over 24 years show that market transition enhanced the contribution of family and prior social relationships but not that of common-identity relationships, such as being from the same hometown, which do not involve prior direct personal contact. We also found that during transition, the positive contribution of family members would rise up to a threshold, after which additional family members tended to derail group performance, possibly due to informational disadvantages and a legitimacy discount in the eyes of foreign investors. The study helps to make sense of different predictions about the role of particularistic ties in business group performance and makes an initial attempt at revealing how social structure affects performance.

This transfer links the parent firm's gender hierarchy to women's advancement opportunities in the new firm. Founders from parent firms that historically had women in leadership positions, such that female leadership is institutionalized, are more likely to found firms that promote women into prominent positions. Conversely, founders from firms that historically had women in subordinate positions, such that female subordination is institutionalized, are less likely to promote women into prominent positions. Findings are consistent with the theory and also show that the persistence effect is stronger for founders who were previously lower-ranked employees and for founders who institute an organization of work similar to their parent firm.

We focus on how the relationships between LMX and members' centrality in the advice network and influence depend on two factors: the extent to which members share ties with their leaders in the organization's trust network, which we define as sponsorship, and the centrality of their leaders in the advice network. Our model seeks to explain how sponsorship and leaders' centrality shape the influence members gain by virtue of their LMX relationships and their centrality in advice networks. Longitudinal data gathered from two organizations, using survey and network measures, offer strong support for a nuanced model of the relational antecedents of influence. Both LMX and members' advice centrality are related to influence, but those relationships in turn depend on sponsorship and leaders' centrality. When leaders are high in centrality, sharing ties in the trust network is beneficial: the relationship between members' own advice centrality and influence is positive among members who are high in sponsorship. But when leaders are low in centrality, sharing trust ties is detrimental: the relationship between advice centrality and influence is negative among members who are high in sponsorship and positive among members who are low in sponsorship.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2189/asqu.50.4.505","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","3","['influence', 'trust network', 'leader-member exchange']","The article discusses relational dynamics within organizations, focusing on influence and trust, which are relevant to DEI themes.

Firms rely on security technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to manage IT security risks. Although the literature on the technical aspects of IT security is proliferating, a debate exists in the IT security community about the value of these technologies. In this paper, we seek to assess the value of IDSs in a firm\u2019s IT security architecture. We find that the IDS configuration, represented by detection (true positive) and false alarm (false positive) rates, determines whether a firm realizes a positive or negative value from the IDS. Specifically, we show that a firm realizes a positive value from an IDS only when the detection rate is higher than a critical value, which is determined by the hacker\u2019s benefit and cost parameters. When the firm realizes a positive (negative) value, the IDS deters (sustains) hackers. However, irrespective of whether the firm realizes a positive or negative value from the IDS, the IDS enables the firm to better target its investigation of users, while keeping the detection rate the same. Our results suggest that the positive value of an IDS results not from improved detection per se, but from an increased deterrence enabled by improved detection. Finally, we show that the firm realizes a strictly nonnegative value if the firm configures the IDS optimally based on the hacking environment.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0041","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of IT security and the value of intrusion detection systems without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Individual members of structurally diverse distributed teams need to develop their collaboration know-how to work effectively with others on their team. The lack of face-to-face cues creates challenges in developing the collaboration know-how\u2014challenges that can be overcome by communicating not just content, but also context. We derive a theoretical model from Te\u2019eni\u2019s (2001) cognitive-affective model of communication to elaborate how information technology (IT) can support an individual\u2019s communication of context to develop collaboration know-how. Two hundred and sixty-three individuals working in structurally diverse distributed teams using a variety of virtual workspace technologies to support their communication needs were surveyed to test the model. Results indicate that when individuals perceive their task as nonroutine, there is a positive relationship between an individual\u2019s perceived degree of IT support for communicating context information and his collaboration know-how development. However, when individuals perceive their task as routine, partial IT support for contextualization is associated with lower levels of collaboration know-how development. This finding is attributed to individuals\u2019 misunderstanding of the conveyed context, or their struggling to utilize the context conveyed with partial IT support, making a routine task more prone to misunderstanding and leaving the user worse than if she had no IT support for contextualization.

Unlike the typical focus on adoption as found in the literature, we focus on postadoption stages, that is, actual usage and value creation. The model thus moves beyond dichotomous \u201cadoption versus nonadoption\u201d and accounts for the \u201cmissing link\u201d\u2014actual usage\u2014as a critical stage of value creation. The model links technological, organizational, and environmental factors to e-business use and value, based on which a series of hypotheses are developed. The theoretical model is tested by using structural equation modeling on a dataset of 624 firms across 10 countries in the retail industry. To probe deeper into whether e-business use and value are influenced by economic environments, two subsamples from developed and developing countries are compared. The study finds that technology competence, firm size, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support are important antecedents of e-business use. In addition, the study finds that, while both front-end and back-end capabilities contribute to e-business value, back-end integration has a much stronger impact. While front-end functionalities are becoming commodities, e-businesses are more differentiated by back-end integration. This is consistent with the resource-based theory because back-end integration possesses the value-creating characteristics of resources (e.g., firm specific, difficult to imitate), which are strengthened by the Internet-enabled connectivity. Our study also adds an international dimension to the innovation diffusion literature, showing that careful attention must be paid to the economic and regulatory factors that may affect technology diffusion across different countries.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0045","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['economic environments', 'developing countries', 'value creation']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of e-business adoption and value creation, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

We propose two methods to compensate for input distortion. The first method, termed knowledge base modification, considers redesigning the knowledge base of an expert system to best account for distortion in the input provided by the user. The second method, termed input modification, modifies the input directly to account for distortion and uses the modified input in the existing (unmodified) knowledge base of the system. These methods are compared with an approach where input noise is ignored. Experimental results indicate that both types of modification substantially improve the accuracy of recommendations, with knowledge base modification outperforming input modification in most cases. Knowledge base modification is, however, more computationally intensive than input modification. Therefore, when computational resources are adequate, the knowledge base modification approach is preferred; when such resources are very limited, input modification may be the only viable alternative.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0046","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical methods for improving the accuracy of expert systems without addressing any social justice, ethical, or diversity themes.

An Empirical Study of Social Loafing in Technology-Supported Groups","Research on group behavior has identified social loafing, i.e., the tendency of members to do less than their potential, as a particularly serious problem plaguing groups. Social Impact Theory (SIT) helps explain social loafing in terms of two theoretical dimensions\u2014the dilution effect (where an individual feels submerged in the group) and the immediacy gap (where an individual feels isolated from the group). In this study, which employed a controlled experiment, we investigated these dimensions of social loafing in the context of group decision making, using collocated and distributed teams of varying sizes. Our results\u2014in line with SIT\u2014indicate that small groups, signifying a small dilution effect, had increased individual contributions and better group outcomes compared to their larger counterparts. However, support for SIT's arguments about the immediacy gap was mixed: Members contributed visibly more when they were collocated, but no significant differences in group outcomes were evident. Regardless of dimension, the quality of the input (ideas generated) determined the quality of the output (decisions made). Also, contrary to the literature on brainstorming, having more ideas to work with resulted in poorer-quality decisions. This apparent paradox is explained using the notion of integrative complexity, which challenges conventional wisdom regarding the relationship between individual inputs and group outputs. The implications of these results for practice and research are examined.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0051","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['social loafing', 'group behavior', 'collocated', 'distributed teams']","The article primarily focuses on group behavior and decision-making processes without a significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or inclusion themes.

Such auctions are referred to as combinatorial auctions. Examples of such auctions include truck delivery routes, industrial procurement, and FCC spectrum. Determining winners in such auctions is an NP-hard problem, and significant research is being conducted in this area. However, multiple-round (iterative) combinatorial auctions present significant challenges in bid formulations as well. Because the combinatorial dynamics in iterative auctions can make a given bid part of a winning and nonwinning set of bids without any changes in the bid, bidders are usually not able to evaluate whether they should revise their bid at a given point in time or not. Therefore, in this paper we address various computational problems that are relevant from the bidder's perspective. In particular, we introduce two bid evaluation metrics that can be used by bidders to determine whether any given bid can be a part of the winning allocation and explore their theoretical properties. Based on these metrics, we also develop efficient data structures and algorithms that provide comprehensive information about the current state of the auction at any time, which can help bidders in evaluating their bids and bidding strategies. Our approach uses exponential memory storage but provides fast incremental update for new bids, thereby facilitating bidder support for real-time iterative combinatorial auctions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0052","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of combinatorial auctions and bid evaluation metrics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To promote the disclosure and sharing of cyber security information among firms, the U.S. federal government has encouraged the establishment of many industry-based Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) under Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63. Sharing security vulnerabilities and technological solutions related to methods for preventing, detecting, and correcting security breaches is the fundamental goal of the ISACs. However, there are a number of interesting economic issues that will affect the achievement of this goal. Using game theory, we develop an analytical framework to investigate the competitive implications of sharing security information and investments in security technologies. We find that security technology investments and security information sharing act as \u201cstrategic complements\u201d in equilibrium. Our results suggest that information sharing is more valuable when product substitutability is higher, implying that such sharing alliances yield greater benefits in more competitive industries. We also highlight that the benefits from such information-sharing alliances increase with the size of the firm. We compare the levels of information sharing and technology investments obtained when firms behave independently (Bertrand-Nash) to those selected by an ISAC, which maximizes social welfare or joint industry profits. Our results help us predict the consequences of establishing organizations such as ISACs, Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), or InfraGard by the federal government.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0053","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['security', 'information sharing', 'social welfare']","The article discusses the economic implications of sharing security information, which touches on the theme of social welfare; however, it primarily focuses on technical and economic aspects rather than social justice or equity.

The objective of reputation mechanisms in such pure moral hazard settings is to induce sellers to exert high effort as often as possible. I study the impact of various mechanism parameters (such as the granularity of solicited feedback, the format of the public reputation profile, the policy regarding missing feedback, and the rules for admitting new sellers) on the resulting market efficiency. I find that maximum efficiency is bounded away from the hypothetical first-best case where sellers can credibly precommit to full cooperation by a factor that is related to the probability that cooperating sellers may receive \u201cunfair\u201d bad ratings. Furthermore, maximum efficiency is independent of the length of past history summarized in a seller's public reputation profile. I apply my framework to a simplified model of eBay's feedback mechanism and conclude that, in pure moral hazard settings, eBay's simple mechanism is capable of inducing the maximum theoretical efficiency independently of the number of recent ratings that are being summarized in a seller's profile. I derive optimal policies for dealing with missing feedback and easy online identity changes. Finally, I show that if the number of buyers is large, the results obtained in the monopoly case are also approximately valid in settings where multiple sellers of different reputations simultaneously offer auctions for identical goods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0054","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['moral hazard', 'reputation', 'efficiency']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of reputation mechanisms in trading environments, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This paper focuses on frequent item sets, the identification of which forms a critical initial step in a variety of data-mining tasks. It presents an optimal approach for hiding sensitive item sets, while keeping the number of modified transactions to a minimum. The approach is particularly attractive as it easily handles databases with millions of transactions.

We use configurational theory to examine organizational practices related to the management of IT human capital. In contrast to much prior work in IT human resource management (HRM) that is focused at the individual level, our inquiry is focused at the organizational level of analysis. Building on strategic human resource management (SHRM) research in general and research on the management of IT professionals in particular, we examine the broad question: Are different configurations of IT HRM practices associated with different IT staff turnover rates? A multidimensional view of IT HRM practices is presented, based on prior IT and SHRM literature. We formalize hypotheses regarding the relationship of turnover with configurations of IT HRM practices grounded in prior theory and empirical research. Based on survey responses from 106 organizations, IT HRM dimensions and configurations are derived and the hypotheses are tested. A five-configuration solution, obtained via cluster analysis, includes two contrasting configurations consistent with two archetypes found in the prior literature. Specifically, the configuration with a human capital focus has lower turnover than the task-focused configuration, providing support for our first hypothesis. Although the hypothesis on intermediate configurations and their relationship with turnover is not supported, we discover and interpret three additional configurations that embody patterns of practices with unique emphases.

These elements can be manipulated by a firm in implementing its personalization strategy. This research also investigates a personal disposition, need for cognition, which plays a role in assessing the effectiveness of web personalization.

As construction proceeds, new errors are introduced into the system. The objective is to deliver a system of the highest possible quality (fewest number of errors) subject to the constraint that N system modules are constructed in a specified duration T. If errors are not corrected during construction, then further construction can produce errors at a faster rate. To curb the growth of errors, some of the effort must be taken away from construction and assigned to testing and debugging. A key finding of this model is that the practice of alternating between pure construction and pure debugging is suboptimal. Instead, it is desirable to concurrently construct and debug the system. We extend the above model to integrate decisions traditionally considered \u201cexternal\u201d such as the time to release the product to the market with those that are typically treated as \u201cinternal\u201d such as the division of effort between construction and debugging. Results show that integrating these decisions can yield significant reduction in the overall cost. Also, when competitive forces are strong, it may be better to release a product early (with more errors) than late (with fewer errors). Thus, underestimating the cost of errors in the product may be better than overestimating the cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0059","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software development and debugging without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, recent accounting scandals and the subsequent requirements enacted in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have made data reliability assessment of critical importance to organizations, particularly for accounting data. Using the accounting functions of management information systems as a context, this paper develops an interdisciplinary approach to data reliability assessment. Our work builds on the literature in accounting and auditing, where reliability assessment has been a topic of study for a number of years. While formal probabilistic approaches have been developed in this literature, they are rarely used in practice. The research reported in this paper attempts to strike a balance between the informal, heuristic-based approaches used by auditors and formal, probabilistic reliability assessment methods. We develop a formal, process-oriented ontology of an accounting information system that defines its components and semantic constraints. We use the ontology to specify data reliability assessment requirements and develop mathematical-model-based decision support methods to implement these requirements. We provide preliminary empirical evidence that the use of our approach improves the efficiency and effectiveness of reliability assessments. Finally, given the recent trend toward specifying information systems using executable business process models (e.g., business process execution language), we discuss opportunities for integrating our process-oriented data reliability assessment approach\u2014developed in the accounting context\u2014in other IS application contexts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0063","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['reliability', 'accounting', 'data']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of data reliability in accounting information systems without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We develop a stylized game-theoretic model to analyze the impact of competition between an incumbent full-service brokerage firm with a bundled offering of research services and trade execution and an online entrant offering just trade execution. We find that as consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for research declines, the incumbent finds it optimal to unbundle its offering when competing with the online entrant. We also find that the online entrant chooses a lower quality of trade execution when faced with direct competition from the incumbent\u2019s unbundled offering. The analytical model motivates a unique field experiment placing actual simultaneous trades with traditional full-service and online brokers, to compare order handling practices and the quality of trade execution. In keeping with our analytical results, our empirical findings show a significant difference in the quality of execution between online brokerages and their full-service counterparts.

Applied to buyer-seller relationships, PCV is defined as a buyer\u2019s perception of having being treated wrongly regarding the terms of an exchange agreement with an individual seller. PCV with individual sellers is proposed as a formative first-order construct driven by the occurrence of fraud, product misrepresentation, contract default, delivery delay, and failure to follow product guarantees and payment policies. PCV with an individual seller is proposed to prompt a generalized perception of PCV with the entire community of sellers in a marketplace. PCV with the community of sellers is hypothesized to negatively affect buyer transaction behavior in a marketplace by directly impacting transaction intentions, price premiums, trust, perceived risk, and the perceived effectiveness of institutional structures. PCV is also hypothesized to act as a moderator, transforming the buyers\u2019 initial trust-based mindset to one more centered on perceived risk. Finally, PCV is hypothesized to attenuate the positive impact of trust on transaction intentions, while reinforcing the negative impact of perceived risk on transaction intentions. It is also proposed to attenuate the impact of the perceived effectiveness of institutional structures on trust, while strengthening its negative effect on perceived risk. As a means of preventing PCV, the buyers\u2019 positive experience and the sellers\u2019 favorable past performance are hypothesized to make PCV with the community of sellers less likely. A combination of primary and secondary longitudinal data from 404 buyers in eBay\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s online auctions support the proposed hypotheses, validating PCV as a central element of buyer-seller relationships in online marketplaces. Interestingly, ex post facto results show that buyers with higher perceptions of PCV with the community of sellers are less likely to experience PCV with an individual seller in the future. Implications for buyer-seller relationships in online marketplaces and the PCV literature are discussed. Also discussed is how the increasing number of buyers who experience PCV in online marketplaces extends the literature that has been largely developed based on buyers who had not experienced PCV.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0065","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['psychological contract', 'buyer-seller relationships', 'trust', 'perceived risk']","The article discusses buyer-seller relationships and the implications of Psychological Contract Violation (PCV), touching on themes of trust and perceived risk.

This paper develops a pricing model for digital experience goods in a segmented market and explores the optimality of sampling as a piracy-mitigating strategy. Consumers are aware of the true fit of an experience good to their tastes only after consumption, and as piracy offers an additional (albeit illegal) consumption opportunity, traditional segmentation findings from economics and sampling recommendations from marketing, need to be revisited. We develop a two-stage model of piracy for a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation for quality and their moral costs. In our model, some consumers pirate the product in the first stage allowing them to update their fit-perception that may result in re-evaluation of their buying/pirating decision in the second stage. We recommend distinct pricing and sampling strategies for underestimated and overestimated products and suggest that any potential benefits of piracy can be internalized through product sampling. Two counterintuitive results stand out. First, piracy losses are more severe for products that do not live up to their hype rather than for those that have been undervalued in the market, thus requiring a greater deterrence investment for the former, and second, unlike physical goods where sampling is always beneficial for underestimated products, sampling for digital goods is optimal only under narrowly defined circumstances due to the price boundaries created by both piracy and segmentation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0069","","ISR","Information Systems","2","['piracy', 'digital goods', 'pricing', 'sampling', 'market']","The article primarily focuses on pricing strategies and market segmentation related to digital goods and piracy, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The objective of this study is to compare two contrasting views in the literature on the nature of automatic use, namely, the habit/automaticity perspective (HAP) and the instant activation perspective (IAP). According to HAP, automatic use occurs because of the force of habit/automaticity without the formation of evaluations and intention; thus, past use\u2014which is a proxy for habit/automaticity\u2014is believed to weaken the evaluations-intention-usage relationship. In contrast, IAP posits that automatic use is simply an expedited form of conscious use; accordingly, as with conscious use, automatic use is still a function of evaluations/intention, so past use will not weaken the evaluations-intention-usage relationship. We tested the competing hypotheses using 2,075 cross-sectional and 990 longitudinal responses from actual users of two online news sites. Our results show that the evaluations-intention-usage relationship is generally weaker among heavier users than among lighter users. These findings suggest that with an increase in past use, user behavior becomes less evaluative and less intentional, in support of the argument that automatic use is driven more by habit/automaticity than by instant activation of cognitions. Overall, this research shows an initial piece of evidence of the moderating role of past use in postadoption phenomena, and it is expected to help the information systems community systematically investigate the important yet underexplored subject of habit/automaticity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0070","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of user behavior and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In Stage 1, they attract customers to their websites through advertising. In Stage 2, firms generate sales transactions or sales leads through their website. Comprehensive assessment of the promotional performance of pure online firms requires the study of Stage 1 and of Stage 2 jointly. In this paper we develop a joint two-stage conceptual and econometric model for assessing website promotion on three important dimensions: (1) how advertising response can be measured by linking media schedules to website log files; (2) how advertising and website characteristics jointly affect the desired system outcome of the promotion; and (3) whether the joint investigation of advertising response and desired system outcomes is essential to assess the results of website promotion. Three general findings follow from application of our model to a pure online firm\u2019s campaign to generate sales leads through print advertising. First, advertising and website characteristics affect sales leads in different ways. A characteristic may influence sales leads directly, or indirectly, or both. Second, assessing advertising effectiveness in an online environment may not require costly survey research data. Instead, secondary data available from website log files may be used for such assessment. Third, the interaction between the first and second stages of our two-stage model can lead to misspecifications that produce misleading inferences. This occurs because the unobserved characteristics in generating website visits and sales leads may be correlated.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1050.0071","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for assessing promotional performance in online firms without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper stresses such multi-faceted judgments by addressing the joint effect of information disclosure on competitors and third-party information providers. While the desire to keep competitors out-of-the-loop may point to a firm keeping proprietary information away from the public eye, the presence of other information providers (e.g., analysts and media outlets) can play a key role. In particular, a firm may benefit from public disclosure because it serves to guide the information gathering and dissemination of third parties. Though the direct effect of disclosure is to unduly arm competitors with information, the reverberations that come in the form of directing the herd of information providers may make it worthwhile.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410105000662","research article","JAE","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of disclosure policies and competition without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Insiders (managers and venture capitalists) who sell their pre-offering shareholdings might try to increase the IPO offer price (1) by overinvesting in R&D to signal the firm's prospects (the signaling hypothesis) or (2) by underinvesting in R&D to increase current reported earnings (the earnings fixation hypothesis). We find that, for a sample of 243 IPOs from 1986 to 1990, change in R&D spending in the year of the IPO is negatively related to managerial selling. Because reductions in R&D spending increase current earnings at the expense of future earnings, our evidence suggests that managers believe that investors place more emphasis on current earnings and less emphasis on R&D and therefore spend less on R&D. We also document a positive association between discretionary current accruals in the offering year and managerial selling, suggesting that selling managers manipulate accruals as well.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679x.2004.00161.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of insider trading and its impact on R&D expenditures without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

We examine whether external independent auditors are employed as monitors or as bonding mechanisms, or both, to alleviate the agency problems. Using a broad sample from eight East Asian economies, we document that firms with agency problems embedded in the ownership structures are more likely to employ Big 5 auditors. This relation is evident among firms that raise equity capital frequently. Consistently, firms hiring Big 5 auditors receive smaller share price discounts associated with the agency conflicts. Also, we find that Big 5 auditors take into consideration their clients' agency problems when making audit fee and audit report decisions.

Our valuation approach accounts for the jointly determined nature of ESO and shareholder values.

We use our valuation approach to assess the implications of dilution on the fair-value estimates of ESO grants.

In particular, we examine the relation between audit fees and business risk for audit clients doing business in developing countries where bribery of top government officials has been an accepted business practice. We hypothesize that bribery-paying clients are riskier because of both client business risk and audit business risk. Using data collected from Securities and Exchange Commission filings and audit fee data in the 1970s, before the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, we provide evidence that audit fees were higher for clients that disclosed paying bribes. This evidence is consistent with an audit market where auditors assess business risk at the client level, then pass their expected costs to the client in the form of higher audit fees.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679x.2005.00165.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","3","['business risk', 'misconduct', 'bribery']","The article discusses business risk in the context of client misconduct and bribery, which touches on ethical considerations in accounting practices.

Motivated by the SOX requirement that public companies disclose whether they have a financial expert on their audit committee, we test whether the market reacts favorably to the appointment of directors with financial expertise to the audit committee. In addition, because it is controversial whether SOX should define financial experts narrowly to include primarily accounting financial experts (as initially proposed) or more broadly to include nonaccounting financial experts (as ultimately passed), we separately examine appointments of each type of expert. We find a positive market reaction to the appointment of accounting financial experts assigned to audit committees but no reaction to nonaccounting financial experts assigned to audit committees, consistent with accounting-based financial skills, but not broader financial skills, improving the audit committee's ability to ensure high-quality financial reporting. In addition, we find that this positive reaction is concentrated among firms with relatively strong corporate governance, consistent with accounting financial expertise complementing strong governance, possibly because strong governance helps channel the expertise toward enhancing shareholder value. Together, these findings are consistent with financial expertise on audit committees improving corporate governance but only when both the expert and the appointing firm possess characteristics that facilitate the effective use of the expertise.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679x.2005.00166.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the financial expertise of audit committee members and its impact on market reactions, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We also document that firms' use of EPS-based compensation contracts significantly affects the likelihood of COCO issuance and find weak evidence that reputation costs, measured using earnings restatement data, play a role in the structuring decision. These results are robust to controlling for alternative motivations for issuing COCOs, including tax and dilution arguments.

We find that firms with less favorable prior-period Standard & Poor's (S&P) bond ratings or higher leverage ratios in comparison to their industry report greater amounts of interest expense on their tax returns than to investors and creditors on their financial statements. These between-firm results are consistent with credit-constrained firms using more structured financing arrangements. Our within-firm tests also suggest that firms use more structured financing arrangements when they enter into contractual loan agreements that provide incentives to manage debt ratings. Specifically, we find that after controlling for S&P bond rating and industry-adjusted leverage, our sample firms report greater amounts of interest expenses for tax than for financial statement purposes when they enter into performance pricing contracts that use senior debt rating covenants to set interest rates. Furthermore, we find that the greatest book-tax reporting changes occur when firms become closer to violating these debt rating covenants.

Traditional measures of accruals are, however, functions of current- and non-current-period transactions. We show that the inclusion of non-current-period transactions leads to a downward (upward) bias on the persistence of accruals (cash flows). We develop alternative measures of accruals and cash flows that are not misaligned and show that the differential persistence of cash flows over accruals is more than 70% smaller using these measures.

The inflation illusion hypothesis suggests that stock market investors fail to incorporate inflation in forecasting future earnings growth rates, and this causes firms whose earnings growths are positively (negatively) related to inflation to be undervalued (overvalued). We argue and show that the sensitivity of earnings growth to inflation varies monotonically across stocks sorted on standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) and, consistent with the inflation illusion hypothesis, show that lagged inflation predicts future earnings growth, abnormal returns, and earnings announcement returns of SUE-sorted stocks. Interestingly, controlling for the return predictive ability of inflation weakens the ability of lagged SUE to predict future returns of SUE-sorted stocks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2005.00181.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock market behavior and earnings forecasting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are essential for a higher woke score."],["2005","43","4","CINDY DURTSCHI,\u00a0\n                     CINDY DURTSCHI\n                     Utah State UniversitySearch for more papers by this authorPETER EASTON,\u00a0\n                     PETER EASTON\n                     University of Notre Dame.Search for more papers by this author","Earnings Management? The Shapes of the Frequency Distributions of Earnings Metrics Are Not Evidence Ipso Facto","We provide evidence that the shapes (particularly around zero) of the frequency distributions of earnings metrics examined in the extant earnings management literature are affected by (1) deflation (using, for example, price or market capitalization), (2) sample selection criteria that lead to differential inclusion/exclusion of observations to the left of zero versus observations to the right of zero (implicit in studies focusing on firms followed by I/B/E/S and explicit in studies partitioning on a variable differing between loss observations and profit observations), (3) differences between the characteristics of observations to the left of zero and observations to the right of zero (such as market pricing and analyst optimism/pessimism), or (4) a combination of these factors. Since the shapes of the frequency distributions of earnings metrics at zero are likely due to one of the above effects, we conclude that the shapes cannot be used as ipso facto evidence of earnings management.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2005.00182.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We also find affiliated analysts issue recommendations sooner and more frequently after an offering than unaffiliated analysts, and that unaffiliated analysts are more likely than affiliated analysts to drop coverage of sample firms.

In the second stage, we examine whether the earnings quality factor is priced and whether insider trading is more profitable for firms with higher exposure to that factor.

Our experiment examines the effects of contract framing on such information use in a principal-agent setting. In each of 40 rounds, participants (as employer and worker) negotiate a contract that specifies pay depending on an ex post state signal. State-signal pay is framed as either a bonus or a penalty over two groups. The results show that the bonus frame facilitates information use, because of worker loss aversion. Although both groups initially underweigh the state signal, the bonus group quickly converges toward the optimal weight, whereas the penalty group persistently underweighs the state signal.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2005.00187.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical management accounting issue related to decision-influencing information and contract framing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Using a sample of 831 departments in 59 Washington State hospitals over the 1977\u20131994 period, we find that the ratio of variable to total costs increased after 1983. This increase is not attributable to a gradual increase in the ratio over time: We estimate a significant increase after 1983 even after controlling for a time trend. Further, we find a greater increase in the variable-to-total cost ratio for hospitals that had higher percentages of Medicare patients, increasing our confidence in the conclusion that the change in cost behavior is attributable to Medicare's change in reimbursement.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2005.00188.x","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of cost behavior in hospitals without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Prototype theory predicts that adding alternatives should produce assimilation, whereas multiattribute range-frequency theory predicts that it creates contrast. We reconcile these two theories by assuming that single-peaked preferences reflect a composition of underlying benefit and cost valuations. Moreover, we claim that the correlational structure of the benefit and cost dimensions in the contextual stimuli determines whether these stimuli will exert an assimilation or contrast effect. We show that when benefits and costs are correlated (uncorrelated), adding alternatives that extend the range of offerings produces assimilation (contrast) for preference judgments. We propose a cost-benefit trade-off model that incorporates elements of single-peaked preference theory and range-frequency theory to explain the complex fashion in which contextual stimuli affect consumer ideals.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/31/1/112/1812003","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer preferences and theoretical models related to cost-benefit analysis without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical approach."],["2005","31","1","Rongrong Zhou\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Rongrong Zhou\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Michel Tuan Pham\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Michel Tuan Pham\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar","Promotion and Prevention across Mental Accounts: When Financial Products Dictate Consumers& Investment GoalsGet access","We propose that consumers& investment decisions involve processes of promotion and prevention regulation that are managed across separate mental accounts, with different financial products seen as representative of promotion versus prevention.

A review of published studies reporting information about the scale and analysis of 15 raw data sets that contain the MVS and other measures revealed that the MVS performs well in terms of reliability and empirical usefulness, but the dimensional structure proposed by Richins and Dawson is not always evident in the data. This article proposes a 15-item measure of the MVS that has better dimension properties than the original version. It also reports the development of a short version of the MVS. Scale lengths of nine, six, and three items were investigated. Results indicate that the nine-item version possesses acceptable psychometric properties when used to measure materialism at a general level. This article also describes a psychometric approach for developing shorter versions of extant multiitem measures.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/31/1/209/1812032","re-inquiries","JCR","Marketing","2","['materialism', 'consumer behavior', 'psychometric']","The article primarily focuses on the measurement properties of the Material Values Scale and does not engage with socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

Prior research has argued that extremeness aversion is a function of the relational properties of choice alternatives and that the middle option, defined such that its attribute values are between the values of the other alternatives, is always viewed as the least extreme, compromise option. The attribute-balance hypothesis advanced in this article extends prior research, demonstrating that extremeness aversion is also a function of the dispersion of attribute values within each alternative. In particular, it is argued that an option with equal attribute ratings will be perceived as the compromise alternative even when it is not the middle option. Data from three studies support this prediction, offering converging evidence for the attribute-balance effect in different decision contexts.

This research demonstrates that preference for the status quo is a function of goal orientation and, in particular, that it tends to be more pronounced for prevention-focused than for promotion-focused consumers. The preference for the status quo was examined on two dimensions: preference for the status quo alternative and preference for inaction over action. In this context, it is shown that the impact of goal orientation on the preference for the status quo can occur independently of loss aversion\u2014a finding consistent with the notion that goal orientation might impact choice by virtue of motivational factors such as self-regulation of anticipated regret.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/31/3/557/1800482","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and goal orientation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Little research has investigated the ways in which global brands structure these expressions of cultural heterogeneity and consumers' corresponding experiences of glocalization. To redress this gap, we develop the construct of the hegemonic brandscape. We use this theoretical lens to explicate the hegemonic influence that Starbucks exerts upon the sociocultural milieus of local coffee shops via its market-driving servicescape and a nexus of oppositional meanings (i.e., the anti-Starbucks discourse) that circulate in popular culture. This hegemonic brandscape supports two distinctive forms of local coffee shop experience through which consumers, respectively, forge aestheticized and politicized anticorporate identifications.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/31/3/631/1800532","articles","JCR","Marketing","7","['anticorporate', 'hegemonic', 'cultural heterogeneity', 'politicized', 'local cultures']","The article explores the hegemonic influence of Starbucks on local cultures and the anticorporate sentiments that arise in response, indicating a strong focus on cultural and social dynamics rather than purely profit-driven motives.

In a first experiment in which we track consumer choices across a sequence of choice occasions, we show that retracting a discount posted by a higher quality, higher price brand is detrimental to that brand. In contrast, a discount posted by a lower quality, lower price brand is capable of enduringly diverting consumers away from high-end brands. A second experiment relies on process measures to provide evidence for the underlying price salience mechanism. A third experiment tests our hypotheses with real incentives and offers additional support for our price salience theory by testing its most peculiar behavioral implication.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/31/3/652/1800545","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on consumer choice and pricing strategies without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The results of four studies suggest that, although circumstantial differences between buying and selling decisions can lead to systematic differences in susceptibility to anchoring effects, the principles governing the impact of anchoring on WTP and WTA judgments are essentially the same.

Supporting this conceptualization, the results indicate that preferences for effort-congruent rewards are attenuated among consumers with lower psychological reactance, after a reactance-reduction manipulation, when rewards are independent of personal effort, and when rewards are a by-product rather than the intention of effort.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/31/4/725/1812917","articles","JCR","Marketing","2","['autonomy', 'intrinsically motivated', 'effort-congruent']","The article discusses consumer autonomy and intrinsic motivation, which touch on individual agency but do not strongly emphasize social justice or critical theory themes.

Search from different orderings exposes consumers to sequences of options characterized by different key psychological moments (trend and end) as well as to different levels of average quality.

Our traders appear highly loss-averse, regularly assuming above-average afternoon risk to recover from morning losses. This behavior has important short-term consequences for afternoon prices, as losing traders actively purchase contracts at higher prices and sell contracts at lower prices than those that prevailed previously. However, the market appears to distinguish these risk-seeking trades from informed trading. Prices set by loss-averse traders are reversed significantly more quickly than those set by unbiased traders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00723.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on behavioral biases among traders and their impact on market prices, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We document that analyst following increases after initial enforcement of insider trading laws. This increase is concentrated in emerging market countries, but is smaller if the country has previously liberalized its capital market. We also find that analyst following responds less intensely to initial enforcement when a country has a preexisting portfolio of strong investor protections.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00724.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on insider trading laws and their impact on analyst behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Shareholder returns to retention decisions are positively correlated with growth opportunities and benchmarked investment, but negatively correlated with benchmarked investment for firms with poor growth opportunities. Shareholder returns to debt distributions are increasing in industry-benchmarked leverage.

We extend this model to account for time-varying expected inflation, and estimate the model with both inflation and term structure data. The estimates imply that the bond portfolio of a long-run investor looks very different from the portfolio of a mean-variance optimizer.

Using a model in which the aftermarket price of IPO shares depends on the information about the intrinsic value of the company and investor sentiment, I show that IPOs can be overpriced and still exhibit positive initial return. A sample of recent French offerings with a fraction of the shares reserved for individual investors supports the predictions of the model. Individual investors' demand is positively related to market conditions. Moreover, large individual investors' demand leads to high IPO prices, large initial returns, and poor long-run performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00736.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPO pricing and investor sentiment without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

An Experimental Analysis","Two behavioral concepts, loss aversion and mental accounting, have been combined to provide a theoretical explanation of the equity premium puzzle. Recent experimental evidence supports the theory, as students' behavior has been found to be consistent with myopic loss aversion (MLA). Yet, much like certain anomalies in the realm of riskless decision-making, these behavioral tendencies may be attenuated among professionals. Using traders recruited from the CBOT, we do indeed find behavioral differences between professionals and students, but rather than discovering that the anomaly is muted, we find that traders exhibit behavior consistent with MLA to a greater extent than students.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00737.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on behavioral finance concepts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Unfortunately, liquidity and solvency problems interact and can cause each other, making it hard to determine the cause of a crisis.

We show that this result is driven by small stocks traded on the Nasdaq, and is in part due to a liquidity premium. In addition, their result does not hold for the extended sample of 1963:08 to 2001:12 and for the NYSE/AMEX and NYSE stocks. More importantly, we find no evidence of a significant link between the value-weighted portfolio returns and the median and value-weighted average stock volatility.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00750.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical financial analysis and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Selecting the Interest Rate Exposure of Corporate Debt","This paper examines whether firms are hedging or timing the market when selecting the interest rate exposure of their new debt issuances. I use a more accurate measure of the interest rate exposure chosen by firms by combining the initial exposure of newly issued debt securities with their use of interest rate swaps. The results indicate that the final interest rate exposure is largely driven by the slope of the yield curve at the time the debt is issued. These results suggest that interest rate risk management practices are primarily driven by speculation or myopia, not hedging considerations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00751.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of corporate debt and interest rate exposure without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Researchers have interpreted this finding as evidence that corporate managers are able to predict the systematic component of their stock returns and to issue equity when the market is overvalued.

A decrease in house prices reduces the collateral value of housing, increases household exposure to idiosyncratic risk, and increases the conditional market price of risk. Using aggregate data for the United States, we find that a decrease in the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth predicts higher returns on stocks. Conditional on this ratio, the covariance of returns with aggregate risk factors explains 80% of the cross-sectional variation in annual size and book-to-market portfolio returns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00759.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and empirical modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2005","60","3","BEN S.

An Examination of the Effect of Leverage on Default Probabilities","A commonly held view in corporate finance is that firms are less leveraged than they should be, given the potentially large tax benefits of debt. In this paper, I study the effect of firms' leverage on default probabilities as represented by the firms' ratings. Using an instrumental variable approach, I find that the leverage's effect on ratings is three times stronger than it is if the endogeneity of leverage is ignored. This stronger effect results in a higher impact of leverage on the ex ante costs of financial distress, which can offset the current estimates of the tax benefits of debt.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00766.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on corporate finance and the technical analysis of leverage and default probabilities without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A simple model identifies three firm attributes related to that variation: investment opportunities, external financing, and ownership structure. Using firm-level governance and transparency data from 27 countries, we find that all three firm attributes are related to the quality of governance and disclosure practices, and firms with higher governance and transparency rankings are valued higher in stock markets. All relations are stronger in less investor-friendly countries, demonstrating that firms adapt to poor legal environments to establish efficient governance practices.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00767.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['corporate governance', 'legal protection', 'transparency']","The article discusses corporate governance and legal environments but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

These results suggest flows are related to short-term currency returns, while fundamentals better explain long-term returns and values.

Results indicate that the stock market development and familiarity variables have significant, but asymmetric, effects on the domestic bias (domestic investors overweighting the local markets) and foreign bias (foreign investors under or overweighting the overseas markets), and that economic development, capital controls, and withholding tax variables have significant effects only on the foreign bias.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.768_1.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of mutual fund allocations without addressing any social justice, ethical concerns, or DEI themes.

Controlling for other known factors, IPO firms are less likely to switch underwriters when our behavioral measure indicates they were satisfied with the IPO underwriter's performance.

Better performing partnerships are more likely to raise follow-on funds and larger funds.

Managers' perceptions of fundamental value diverge systematically from market valuations, and perceived mispricing seems an important determinant of managers' decision making. Insider trading patterns shows that low valuation firms are regarded as undervalued by their own managers relative to high valuation firms. This finding is robust to controlling for noninformation motivated trading. Further evidence links managers' private portfolio decisions to changes in corporate capital structures, suggesting that managers try to actively time the market both in their private trades and in firm-level decisions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00783.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial decision-making and market timing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Evidence from Mergers and Acquisitions","I find that the market reaction to a merger and acquisition (M&A) announcement predicts whether the companies later consummate the deal. The relation cannot be explained by the market's anticipation of the closing decision or its perception of the deal quality at the announcement. Merging companies appear to extract information from the market reaction and later consider it in closing the deal. Furthermore, the relation varies with deal characteristics, suggesting that companies seem to have a higher incentive to learn from the market when canceling the announced deal is easier or when the market has more information that the companies do not know.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00784.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on market reactions to mergers and acquisitions without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The resolution of litigation through a court's decision dominates settlement of litigation from the shareholders' point of view, even when the firm loses. We develop a model using agency costs within the firm to explain why the market views settlement as a negative outcome on average and find empirical evidence supporting the implications of the model.

Borrowers of target banks lose about 0.8% in equity value, while borrowers of acquiring banks earn positive abnormal returns, suggesting that borrower welfare is influenced by a strategic focus favoring acquiring borrowers. Bank mergers lead to higher relationship exit rates among borrowers of target banks. Larger merger-induced increases in relationship termination rates are associated with less negative abnormal returns, suggesting that firms with low switching costs switch banks, while similar firms with high switching costs are locked into their current relationship.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00787.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['borrower welfare', 'bank mergers', 'equity value']","The article discusses the impact of bank consolidation on borrower welfare, which touches on ethical considerations in finance.

Consequently, because diffuse creditors suffer from mutual free-riding (Holmstrom (1982)), they fare worse than concentrated creditors (e.g., a house bank). The model predicts that measures of debt concentration relate positively to creditors' (aggregate) debt collection expenditures and positively to management's chosen expenditures to resist paying. However, collection activity is purely redistributive, so social waste is larger when creditors are concentrated. If borrower quality is not known, the best firms choose the most concentrated creditors and pay higher expected yields.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00796.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of creditor concentration and debt collection without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

How Firms and Underwriters Choose Each Other","We develop and test a theory explaining the equilibrium matching of issuers and underwriters. We assume that issuers and underwriters associate by mutual choice, and that underwriter ability and issuer quality are complementary. Our model implies that matching is positive assortative, and that matches are based on firms' and underwriters' relative characteristics at the time of issuance. The model predicts that the market share of top underwriters and their average issue quality varies inversely with issuance volume. Various cross-sectional patterns in underwriting spreads are consistent with equilibrium matching.

After confirming that financing behavior is consistent with the presence of adjustment costs, we find that firms actively rebalance their leverage to stay within an optimal range. Our evidence suggests that the persistent effect of shocks on leverage observed in previous studies is more likely due to adjustment costs than indifference toward capital structure.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00811.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate finance without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In the model, firms make financing, investment, entry, and exit decisions subject to idiosyncratic technology shocks. The capital structure choice reflects the tradeoff between the tax benefits of debt and the associated bankruptcy and agency costs. The interaction between financing and production decisions influences the stationary distribution of firms and their survival probabilities. The analysis demonstrates that the equilibrium output price has an important feedback effect. This effect has a number of testable implications. For example, high growth industries have relatively lower leverage and turnover rates.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00812.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of capital structure and industry dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2005","60","6","ULRIKE MALMENDIER,\u00a0\n                     ULRIKE MALMENDIERSearch for more papers by this authorGEOFFREY TATE,\u00a0\n                     GEOFFREY TATEUlrike Malmendier is at Stanford University and Geoffrey Tate is at the University of Pennsylvania.

Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing. We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel data on personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk. We find that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow, particularly in equity-dependent firms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00813.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on managerial overconfidence and its impact on corporate investment decisions, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We argue that performance-related compensation creates an incentive to look for overly ambitious, hard to implement strategies. At a cost, shareholders can curb this tendency by precommitting to a regime of CEO overcompensation in highly changeable environments. Alternatively shareholders can commit to low CEO pay, although this requires a commitment mechanism (either by the board of the individual company, or by the society as a whole) to counter the incentive to renegotiate upwards. We study the conditions under which the different policies for CEO compensation are preferred by shareholders.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00814.x","articles","JF","Finance","2","['CEO compensation', 'shareholders', 'strategies']","The article primarily focuses on CEO compensation and its impact on corporate strategy, lacking any significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

After controlling for endogeneity in issuer\u2013underwriter matching, I find that reputable banks obtain lower yields and charge higher fees, but issuers' net proceeds are higher. These relations are pronounced in the junk-bond category, in which reputable banks' underwriting criteria are most stringent. These findings suggest that banks' underwriting decisions reflect reputation concerns, and are thus informative of issue quality. They also suggest that economic rents are earned on reputation, and thereby provide continued incentives for underwriters to maintain reputation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00815.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of investment banking, specifically the relationship between reputation and underwriting services, without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2005","60","6","STEVEN DRUCKER,\u00a0\n                     STEVEN DRUCKERSearch for more papers by this authorMANJU PURI,\u00a0\n                     MANJU PURIDrucker is from the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University.

Introducing this bailout possibility, I show that linkages may be optimal ex ante because they allow banks to obtain some mutual insurance even though formal commitments are impossible. However, in some cases (e.g., when liquidity is concentrated among a small group of banks), the whole network may collapse. I also characterize the optimal network size and apply the results to joint liability arrangements and payment systems.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00821.x","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial networks and private sector bailouts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Dividend growth models and international CAPM suggest a significant decline in the equity premium, especially in emerging markets. Consistent with this reduction in the equity premium in the long run, there is a positive short-term price reaction to the switch.

We find that informed traders use more limit orders than do liquidity traders. Our main result is that liquidity provision shifts as trading progresses, with informed traders increasingly providing liquidity in markets. The change in the behavior of the informed traders seems to be in response to the dynamic adjustment of prices to information; they take (provide) liquidity when the value of their information is high (low). Thus, a market-making role emerges endogenously in our electronic markets and is ultimately adopted by the traders who are least subject to adverse selection when placing limit orders.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X0400131X","research article","JFE","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of liquidity in electronic markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, significant evidence exists of a momentum spillover from equities to investment grade corporate bonds of the same firm. Firms earning high (low) equity returns over the previous year earn high (low) bond returns the following year. The spillover results are stronger among firms with lower-grade debt and higher equity trading volume, seem robust to various risk and liquidity controls, and hold even after controlling for past earnings surprises. In examining the source of the spillover, we find that the bond ratings of firms with positive (negative) equity momentum continue to improve (deteriorate) in the future, suggesting underreaction to the information in past equity prices about changing default risk is a likely source of the spillover effect.

We find evidence of spillover effects; that is, a ratings change in one country has a significant effect on sovereign credit spreads of other countries. This effect is asymmetric: positive ratings events abroad have no discernable impact on sovereign spreads, whereas negative ratings events are associated with an increase in spreads. On average, a one-notch downgrade of a sovereign bond is associated with a 12 basis point increase in spreads of sovereign bonds of other countries. The magnitude of the spillover effect following a negative ratings change is amplified by recent ratings changes in other countries. We distinguish between common information and differential components of spillovers. While common information spillovers imply that sovereign spreads move in tandem, differential spillovers are expected to result in opposite effects of ratings events across countries. Despite the predominance of common information spillovers, we also find evidence of differential spillovers among countries with highly negatively correlated capital flows or trade flows vis-\u00e1-vis the United States. That is, spreads in these countries generally fall in response to a downgrade of a country with highly negatively correlated capital or trade flows.

Further, if higher management quality is associated with lower heterogeneity in investor valuations, firms with better managers will have greater long-term stock returns.

(2002. American Economic Review 92 (5), 1335\u20131356) examine the relative importance of property rights and external finance in several Eastern European countries. They find property rights to be overwhelmingly important, while external finance explains little of firm reinvestment. McMillan and Woodruff (2002. Journal of Economic Perspectives 16 (3), 153\u2013170) further conjecture that as transition moves along, market-supporting (financial) institutions should become more important. This paper reexamines those issues in the context of China in 2002, when the transition had moved far. We also find that secure property rights are a significant predictor of firm reinvestment. However, in line with McMillan and Woodruff, we find that access to external finance in the form of bank loans is also associated with more reinvestment. Following Acemoglu and Johnson (2003. Unbundling institutions. Unpublished working paper 9934, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA), we separate our proxies for the security of property rights into two groups: those measuring the risk of expropriation by the government and those measuring the ease and reliability of contract enforcement. Whereas those authors\u2019 cross-country results suggest that risk of expropriation is the more severe impediment to economic development, ours indicate that both expropriation risk and contract enforcement play a role in Chinese firms\u2019 reinvestment decisions. We also find that another aspect of property rights, the extent of private ownership, is associated with greater reinvestment. At China's current stage of development, expropriation risk, contract enforcement, access to finance, and ownership structure all appear to matter for reinvestment decisions.

The dynamic setting relaxes several restrictive assumptions common to static models. In the model, the firm can adjust its use and the hedge ratio and maturity of risk management instruments over time, risk management instruments expire as time progresses, the available maturity of the risk management instruments is shorter than the lifetime of the firm, and transaction costs are associated with initiation and adjustment of risk management contracts. The model produces a number of new time-series and cross-sectional implications on how firms use short-term instruments to hedge long-term cash flow uncertainty. Numerical results describe the optimal timing, adjustment, and rollover of risk management instruments and the choice of contract maturity and hedge ratio in response to changes in the firm's product price. The results show that the structure of transaction costs can have an important effect on the firm's risk management strategy.

Ownership by passive investors with large stock lending programs partly mitigates this under-performance, indicating some impact of stock loan supply.

We respond with development and testing of a framework using partisan and opportunistic political business cycle (PBC) theory to predict the investment risk perceived by investors holding sovereign bonds during 19 presidential elections in 12 developing countries from 1994 to 2000. Consistent with our framework, we find that bondholders perceive higher (lower) investment risk in the form of higher (lower) credit spreads on their sovereign bonds as right-wing (left-wing) political incumbents appear more likely to be replaced by left-wing (right-wing) challengers. For international business research, our findings illustrate the promise of PBC theory in explaining the election-period behavior of sovereign bondholders and, perhaps, other investors who also \u2018vote\u2019 in developing country elections and can substantially influence the price and availability of capital there.

This direct investment vs licensing trade-off, which is built on a business-to-business transaction, does not recognize the linkages with the final products market as a component of transaction cost analysis. By adopting a unilateral perspective on international technology transfer, neither does it consider the possible role of complementary assets (e.g., manufacturing capabilities) held by potential business partners in foreign countries. After taking into account the presence of such assets in indigenous firms, this article extends internalization theory by positioning the technology transfer transaction in the broader context of the entire value chain, including especially the manufacturing/marketing linkages with the final products market. More specifically, it demonstrates that conventional internalization theory neglects various alternative market governance mechanisms not captured by a licensing agreement. The analysis shows that the choice of an optimal governance structure is determined by the complementarity of strategic assets controlled by the economic actors involved, and by the linkages among the technology\u2013manufacture interaction in two intermediate input markets, and the subsequent sales function in the final products market.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400124","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on extending internalization theory in the context of international technology transfer without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Unlike previous studies that view joint venture contractual governance as a unidimensional construct (clause specificity), thus causing a debate upon whether IJV contracts should be more specific, contractual governance herein is defined as a three-dimensional construct that includes the extent to which contractual terms are clearly specified (term specificity), possible contingencies are accounted for (contingency adaptability), and joint venture parties are legally bound to the contract (contractual obligatoriness). Our analysis of IJVs in China suggests that term specificity and contractual obligatoriness increase when the proprietariness of resources to be invested in the IJV or the incompleteness of the host country's legal system increase. Contractual obligatoriness appears to be an increasing function of economic exposure and environmental volatility, whereas contingency adaptability in a contract rises when interparty dependency, investment uncertainty, and knowledge proprietariness intensify or when environmental hazards escalate. These results suggest that an IJV contract, if structured multidimensionally as above, can curtail opportunism and guide venture evolution at the same time. These contractual dimensions should not be prefixed but properly aligned with transactional and institutional characteristics. This alignment has strong implications in reducing transaction costs and spurring IJV evolution in the complex and volatile institutional environment.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400125","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on contractual governance and transactional characteristics in international joint ventures without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We can also examine any regional influences as our sample includes UK, US and Asia Pacific multinational companies (MNCs). As predicted by theory, we find some evidence that MNCs with greater foreign operations have a larger magnitude of FX exposure. However, our proxy for the emphasis of FX management does not have the predicted negative association with the magnitude of FX, indicating that managers may focus on short-term cash flows in their FX management rather than firm value. With regard to the potentially differential regional role of our variables, a range of interesting results is found. Arguably, in our most notable such finding, we see that the contribution of overseas business to total revenues has no association with the magnitude of FX exposure for US MNCs: it has a positive role for UK MNCs (consistent with theory) and a negative role for Asia Pacific MNCs, which could be explained by macroeconomic and/or financial characteristics of the MNCs in the sample.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400155","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of foreign exchange exposure and firm value without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, reflecting a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2005","36","5","Reid W Click1","Financial and political risks in US direct foreign investment","This paper examines the risk of US direct foreign investments over the period 1982\u201398 in 59 host countries.

First, the ROA in a majority of countries does not simply track the worldwide ROA. Second, some cross-country differences are explained by financial risks. Third, unexplained country risk is qualitatively and quantitatively related to unobserved political risk. Fourth, unexplained country risk is also compensated with a higher ROA, enhancing its credibility as a measure of political risk.

Issue-selling \u2013 defined as directing top management's attention to particular issues and helping them understand such issues \u2013 is one important way in which subsidiary managers pursue upward influence. The purpose of this paper is to help multinational organizations better facilitate and exploit potentially valuable input from local subsidiary managers. To do so, we propose an acculturated view of issue-selling. More specifically, we argue that subsidiary managers socialized by different national cultures vary: (1) in the extent to which their intention to sell issues is influenced by various contextual cues; and (2) in their choice of selling strategies. These theoretical differences suggest that local subsidiary managers from different cultures will differ in the way they approach issue-selling and, in turn, in the way they influence the strategy-making process. The discussion traces the implications of this line of reasoning for future research on the influence of local subsidiary managers and, more generally, for research on the cultural embeddedness of the strategy process.","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400166","article","JIBS","Management & Organizations","5","['local culture', 'upward influence', 'cultural embeddedness']","The article discusses the role of local subsidiary managers in multinational organizations, emphasizing the importance of local culture and influence in strategy-making.

The authors use the data to examine the potential chain of effects from customer service employee work\u2013family conflict and family\u2013work conflict, to job stress and job performance, to customer purchase intent (CPI). The results show direct (and indirect) effects of work\u2013family conflict and family\u2013work conflict on service employee customer-directed extra-role performance (CDERP). The results also show direct effects of job stress on service employee in-role performance (IRP) and CDERP and on CPI. Furthermore, the findings show that job stress has a more pronounced effect on IRP than on CDERP and that CDERP has a greater effect on CPI than does IRP. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial and theoretical implications.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.69.2.130.60758","research article","JM","Marketing","5","['work-family conflict', 'job stress', 'employee performance', 'customer service', 'diverse settings']","The article discusses work-family conflict and its impact on employee performance, which touches on themes of employee well-being and diversity in customer settings.

Firms with product development strength have two options: They can leverage it in horizontally related markets, and they can reach into the supply chain to take full advantage of it. The question is how this should be done. One possibility is for the firm to expand its scope, and another is to manage the linkage through contracts. On the basis of the adjustment cost theory of the firm, the author argues that the former solution is more appropriate when product development is fast-paced. This study tests the argument in a sample of several thousand firms and reports four tests. For both types of expansion, the author examines the incidence and the productivity of increased scope. The author uses several measures and finds results that are consistent with the theory.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.69.2.15.60763","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of product development and firm scope without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, aligning it with a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2005","69","2","Ahmet H.

To date, researchers have presented opposing arguments with respect to this important issue. To address this controversy, the authors conceptualize and empirically test a model that links different types of strategic orientations and market forces, through organizational learning, to breakthrough innovations and firm performance. The results show that a market orientation facilitates innovations that use advanced technology and offer greater benefits to mainstream customers (i.e., technology-based innovations) but inhibits innovations that target emerging market segments (i.e., market-based innovations). A technology orientation is beneficial to technology-based innovations but has no impact on market-based innovations, and an entrepreneurial orientation facilitates both types of breakthroughs. Different market forces (demand uncertainty, technology turbulence, and competitive intensity) exert significant influence on technology- and market-based innovations, and these two types of innovations affect firm performance differently.

This research examines the differential impact of cobranded versus solo-branded extensions on customer evaluations of brand counterextensions.

Currently, the literature suggests that a new technology seems to evolve along an S-shaped path, which starts below that of an old technology, intersects it once, and ends above the old technology. This belief is based on scattered empirical evidence and some circular definitions. Using new definitions and data on 14 technologies from four markets, the authors examine the shape and competitive dynamics of technological evolution.

The model further predicts that coercive influence strategies (Promises and Threats) result in compliance only when target dependence levels are high. The authors develop a new influence strategy, Rationality, which represents a noncoercive strategy with a full argument structure. In general, empirical findings support the theoretical model. However, in contrast to expectations, the use of Recommendations had a negative effect on compliance. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant interaction between trust and Recommendations on compliance, thus providing an explanation for this unexpected result.

In May 2003, Richard Staelin, Executive Director of the Teradata Center for Customer Relationship Management at Duke University, proposed that Journal of Marketing (JM) publish a special section. The proposal included activities that were designed to promote interactions among marketing academics and practitioners; the goal was to stimulate dialogue and new research on CRM. I found the proposal attractive because CRM is a broad-based topic that interests many marketers. After extensive discussion, the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Teradata Center formally agreed to cosponsor the special section. Subsequently, there was a conference on Relationship Marketing and Customer Relationship Management (cochaired by Michael Ehret, Wesley Johnston, Michael Kleinaltenkamp, and Lou Pelton) that took place at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin in the summer of 2003; a conference on Customer Management (cosponsored by the Marketing Science Institute and the Teradata Center) that was held at Duke University in March 2004; and two special sessions on CRM that were featured at the AMA Winter Educators' Conference held in San Antonio, Tex., in February 2005. The conferences provided many opportunities for dialogue, and the response from marketers who attended these events was enthusiastic. I also invited Richard Staelin and William Boulding (Executive Codirector of the Teradata Center) to work with me as consulting editors for the special section, and they agreed. A call for papers requested that authors submit their manuscripts to JM by May 2004. The consulting editors and I evaluated every submission with the assistance of an expert panel that included Leonard Berry, John Deighton, Michael Ehret, Christian Gr\u00f6nroos, Sunil Gupta, Wayne Hoyer, Wagner Kamakura, Wesley Johnston, Donald R.

All submissions underwent JM's standard double-blind review process, and members of JM's editorial review board served as reviewers.

They identify five key cross-functional CRM processes: a strategy development process, a value creation process, a multichannel integration process, an information management process, and a performance assessment process. They develop a new conceptual framework based on these processes and explore the role and function of each element in the framework. The synthesis of the diverse concepts within the literature on CRM and relationship marketing into a single, process-based framework should provide deeper insight into achieving success with CRM strategy and implementation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.2005.69.4.167","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on developing a conceptual framework for customer relationship management with an emphasis on enhancing shareholder value, lacking any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2005","69","4","Satish Jayachandran Satish@moore.sc.edu, Subhash Sharma sharma@moore.sc.edu, [\u2026], Peter Kaufman pkaufma@ilstu.edu, and Pushkala Raman dr_p_raman@yahoo.com+1-1","The Role of Relational Information Processes and Technology Use in Customer Relationship\n                        Management","Drawing on the relationship marketing and market information processing literature streams, the authors conceptualize and measure relational information processes, or organizational routines that are critical for customer relationship management (CRM).

The authors argue that a firm's strategic commitments may be an overlooked organizational factor that influences the rewards for a firm's investments in CRM. Using the context of online retailing, the authors consider the effects of two key strategic commitments of online retailers on the performance effect of CRM: their bricks-and-mortar experience and their online entry timing. They test the proposed model with a multimethod approach that uses manager ratings of firm CRM and strategic commitments and third-party customers' ratings of satisfaction from 106 online retailers. The findings indicate that firms with moderate bricks-and-mortar experience are better able to leverage CRM for superior customer satisfaction outcomes than firms with either low or high bricks-and-mortar experience. Likewise, firms with moderate online experience are better able to leverage CRM into superior customer satisfaction outcomes than firms with either low or high online experience.

Geographic Proximity and New Product Development","Many firms rely on external organizations to acquire knowledge that is useful for developing creative new products and reducing the time needed to bring these products to market. Cluster theory suggests that this knowledge is often obtained from organizations located in close geographic proximity. Specifically, proximity is assumed to foster heightened face-to-face communication, strengthened relational ties, increased knowledge acquisition, and enhanced new product outcomes. The authors identify the limitations of these assumptions and offer an enriched model of the influence of geographic proximity on new product development, which they test using both a cross-sectional survey of 155 firms in the U.S. optics industry and a longitudinal follow-up survey of 73 of these firms. They find that firms located in close proximity engage in increased face-to-face communication, but this communication has little effect on the acquisition of the types of knowledge that lead to enhanced new product outcomes. In contrast, they find that e-mail communication leads to both enhanced new product creativity and development speed. In addition, they find that relational ties moderate rather than mediate the path connecting geographic proximity and new product outcomes. These findings imply that the new product development outcomes typically ascribed to close geographic proximity may actually be attributed to strong relational ties.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.2005.69.4.44","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on geographic proximity and its impact on new product development without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Although the resolution of what is termed the \u201ccapability\u2013rigidity paradox\u201d is considered a fundamental managerial task in enhancing product innovation outcomes and the firm's competitive advantage, it has received little research attention. The author argues and finds support that market orientation provides a key to this paradox. Specifically, customer and competitor orientations ensure simultaneous investments in exploiting existing product innovation competencies and exploring new ones. The author also finds that the effects of these orientations on competence exploitation and exploration are differentially moderated by interfunctional coordination and perceived market opportunity. Regarding outcomes, competence exploitation and exploration have opposing relationships with incremental and radical innovation performance. However, the relationship between competence exploration and radical innovation performance is positively moderated by interfunctional coordination. Overall, the results of this study suggest that market orientation can prevent a firm from becoming operationally efficient but strategically inefficient by simultaneously engendering competence exploitation and exploration, which are differentially related to incremental and radical product innovation outcomes.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.2005.69.4.61","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['innovation', 'market orientation', 'competence']","The article primarily focuses on strategic management and product innovation without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, no methodology is available to assess empirically how the demand for multipurpose shopping depends on retail agglomeration or, in general, the characteristics of retail supply, such as the numbers and types of stores in a shopping center or the number of categories in a supermarket. The authors propose a nested-logit model that captures retail agglomeration effects on consumer choice of shopping trip purpose (what to buy) and destination (where to buy). The authors estimate parameters representing trip purpose-adjustment and between-store attraction effects on shopping trip data collected from a sample of 1704 households in The Netherlands. Both effects are significant for each of the three categories for which the model is estimated. This is consistent with the idea of agglomeration effects. The findings suggest that agglomeration helps attract not only multipurpose but also single-purpose trips. A comparison of multi- and single-purpose trip model predictions shows that single-purpose models underpredict the number of trips to larger shopping centers.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.42.1.109.56884","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model assessing retail agglomeration effects on consumer behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

First, relative preferences between hedonic and utilitarian alternatives can reverse, depending on how the immediate purchase situation presents itself. A hedonic alternative tends to be rated more highly than a comparable utilitarian alternative when each is presented singly, but the utilitarian alternative tends to be chosen over the hedonic alternative when the two are presented jointly. Second, people have preferences for expending different combinations of time (effort) and money for acquiring hedonic versus utilitarian items.

The authors expand Novemsky and Kahneman's summary by exploring two critical constructs that help define the boundaries of loss aversion: emotional attachment and cognitive perspective. Emotional attachment alters loss aversion by moderating the degree to which parting with an item involves a loss, whereas shifts in cognitive perspective explain why items typically viewed as a loss are given more or less weight. The goal is to use these constructs to characterize more specifically contexts in which losses loom larger than gains and to suggest specific ways that research into loss aversion could evolve.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.42.2.134.62283","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the psychological constructs of loss aversion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In an influential meta-analytical study, Tellis (1988) summarized price elasticity research findings until 1986. However, empirical generalizations on price elasticity require modifications because of (1) changes in market characteristics (i.e., characteristics of brands, product categories, and economic conditions) and (2) changes in the research methodology used to assess price elasticities. Therefore, the authors present a meta-analysis of price elasticity with new empirical generalizations on its determinants. Across a set of 1851 price elasticities based on 81 studies, the average price elasticity is \u22122.62. A salient finding is that over the past four decades, sales elasticities have significantly increased in magnitude, whereas share and choice elasticities have remained fairly constant. The authors find that accommodating price endogeneity has a strong (magnitude-increasing) impact on price elasticities. A striking null result is that accounting for heterogeneity does not affect elasticities significantly. The authors also present an analysis that explains the difference between their findings and Tellis's findings, and they indicate which new price elasticity studies are most desirable.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.42.2.141.62296","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical aspects of price elasticity and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The authors propose a dual-process model of somatosensory experiences to account for the findings. In line with the model, the findings suggest that the ultimate pleasure that a consumer derives from the taste of a food sample depends on two components, an informational component and an affective component.

The authors show that SKU-level parameters can be recovered by calculation from estimated attribute-level parameters, circumventing the need for direct estimation of the more complex SKU-level model. They calibrate the store data market share model using 98 weeks of data for ten brands and 168 SKUs of toothpaste. Rather than estimate 168 preference parameters (when there is an \u201coutside\u201d alternative in addition to the 168 \u201cinside\u201d ones), it is only necessary to estimate ten brand-preference parameters from which the 168 parameters can be computed, as long as share and marketing-mix data are available at the SKU level.

A counterextension is a brand extension that is launched into Category A by Brand 2 that belongs to Category B in a reciprocal direction to a launch of a previous extension into Category B by Brand 1 that belongs to Category A. The results from five studies show that customers evaluate a counterextension more favorably when the preceding extension is a success rather than a failure. Furthermore, the evaluation of the counterextension is superior if it is launched by a major brand, especially if the previous successful extension was also launched by a major brand. Finally, a successful extension indirectly dilutes a brand and results in a greater loss in choice share to a counterextension than does a failed extension.

In this study, the authors investigate consumers' evaluations of different mass customization configurations when they are asked to mass customize a product. For example, mass customization configurations may differ in the number of modules that can be mass customized. In the context of mass customization of personal computers, the authors find that mass customization configuration affects the product utility that consumers can achieve in mass customization as well as their perception of mass customization complexity. In turn, product utility and complexity affect the utility that consumers derive from using a certain mass customization configuration. More specifically, product utility has a positive effect and complexity has a negative effect on mass customization utility. The effect of complexity is direct as well as indirect because complexity also lowers product utility. The authors also find that consumers with high levels of product expertise consider mass customization configurations less complex than do consumers with low levels of product expertise and that for more-expert consumers, complexity has a less-negative impact on product utility. The study has important managerial implications for how companies can design their mass customization configuration to increase utility and decrease complexity.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.42.2.219.62293","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","['customization', 'utility', 'complexity']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of mass customization in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, if manufacturers are modeled as Bertrand-Nash competitors to their retailer or as Stackelberg pricing followers to their retailer, the equilibrium outcomes change depending on how the retailer's pricing decision variables are defined. Moreover, if in these two cases manufacturers and retailer are allowed to define their own pricing decision variables, then (1) manufacturers are indifferent about choosing among absolute prices, absolute margins, and percentage margins, but (2) the retailer chooses percentage margins.

The authors propose an alternative model in which consumers use only \u201cordered value\u201d information; that is, utilities are functions only of the relative orderings of the attributes' values across alternatives (e.g., choices depend only on the price ordering and not on actual prices). The ordered value model is attractive because it fits well with psychological evidence that consumers often favor decision mechanisms that are cognitively less demanding. Using a supermarket shopper panel data set, the authors evaluate four models in which (1) all consumers use actual values; (2) all consumers use ordered values; (3) some consumers use actual values all the time, and some consumers use ordered values all the time; and (4) all consumers use both actual values and ordered values but with different propensities. In the analysis, the ordered value model finds stronger support than the actual value model: Model 1 outperforms Model 2; in the two hybrid choice models (Models 3 and 4), ordered value processing is more prevalent than actual value processing.

The author offers an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a credible price image even with this vagueness. When retailers must incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is because attracting too many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's higher-priced products on the basis of vague promises imposes unwanted selling costs but yields little extra revenue. Therefore, a store with a relatively high selling cost will be dissuaded from attempting to use such a strategy.

From this principle, the authors derive predictions and test them using data from 193 original equipment manufacturers that engage independent component suppliers. The data show that investments must be aligned with more complete contract terms (e.g., fixed prices, \u201chard\u201d designs) to yield cost reduction outcomes for all firms. However, investments must be aligned with more incomplete contracts (e.g., cost-plus prices, \u201csoft\u201d designs) to yield end-product enhancement outcomes, but only for firms with relatively small downstream market margins. Firms with larger downstream market margins find that the previous alignment reduces end-product enhancements.

The framework draws on research in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly affects the likelihood of choice reversal.

In Study 2, the authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of prechoice thoughts.

When using these data at the stockkeeping unit or the Universal Product Code level, choices for each item in each of the time periods under consideration cannot be observed. Without such information, it is difficult to control for item- and time period\u2013specific unmeasured characteristics because there is no information on alternatives during those periods in which they are not purchased by any of the panelists. In general, when a product category has many alternatives, each with fairly small shares, the household sample may not contain sufficient choices for each alternative, thus negatively affecting the ability to control for endogeneity with household data. In contrast, because aggregate store-level data (for those stores in which the panel makes purchases) are the aggregation of purchases by all households visiting the stores, the data contain the time period\u2013specific item-level information required to account for endogeneity as long as each item has some sales in each time period. Given the relative merits of household data to estimate the distribution of heterogeneity and store-level data to address the endogeneity problem, the authors propose an integrated estimation procedure that uses the information in both sources. They provide empirical results from their model using data on the fabric softener market.

However, too many features can make a product overwhelming for consumers and difficult to use. Three studies examine how consumers balance their desires for capability and usability when they evaluate products and how these desires shift over time. Because consumers give more weight to capability and less weight to usability before use than after use, they tend to choose overly complex products that do not maximize their satisfaction when they use them, resulting in \u201dfeature fatigue.\u201d An analytical model based on these results provides additional insights into the feature fatigue effect. This model shows that choosing the number of features that maximizes initial choice results in the inclusion of too many features, potentially decreasing customer lifetime value. As the emphasis on future sales increases, the optimal number of features decreases. The results suggest that firms should consider having a larger number of more specialized products, each with a limited number of features, rather than loading all possible features into one product.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.431","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product features without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The authors model each group's contribution as the number of daily buyers times their average expenditures. The model also includes the number of nonbuyers because they may return as customers. Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use personnel time. Model application to two years of daily data from six clothing stores reveals that the number of nonmembers who buy is much more responsive to price discounts than the number of members who buy.

The framework adds to the inference-making literature by uncovering two distinct paths of inference updating and by emphasizing the moderating role of trait accessibility.

Second, they relax the assumption that consumers make deterministic judgments when evaluating alternatives. They combine the two generalizations into a probabilistic subset-conjunctive rule, which allows consumers to use any number or subset of decision criteria when screening alternatives and permits them to be uncertain about the acceptability of attribute levels. These two features allow for a screening process that is uncertain and more flexible than the deterministic conjunctive and disjunctive rules currently described in the literature. The authors describe a latent-class method for the estimation of the subset-conjunctive rules and the attribute-level consideration probabilities using either consideration or choice data.

Most theoretical approaches to vertical integration of the distribution function pose the classic question of whether to forward integrate or use independent entities. Having concurrent channels means doing both. This phenomenon is poorly understood, even though it has been growing rapidly. The authors argue that under certain circumstances, it is impossible for manufacturers to prevent channel types from competing with each other, either because both channel types contact the same customer or because the customer sets them in competition against each other. The authors argue that when these situations are frequent or more consequential for the parties involved, firms reduce their usage of concurrent channels to prevent severe channel conflict. The authors posit five such circumstances. Using original data from prominent manufacturers operating in competitive markets worldwide, they model usage of both types of channels to cover one geography with the same products. They find substantial support for their model. Furthermore, in a subset of firms that use both channel types in the same market, they model the degree to which direct and indirect channels compete destructively against each other when contacting the same customers. The authors find that suppliers reduce such behavior by incurring costs to differentiate each channel's offerings, setting out \u201drules of engagement,\u201d and compensating both channel types when either one makes a sale.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.507","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of channel structure in marketing without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this article, the authors compare the impact on retailer profitability of two price discrimination mechanisms: quantity discounts based on package size (second-degree price discrimination) and store-level pricing or micromarketing (third-degree price discrimination). Whereas the latter has been well addressed in the marketing literature, there is limited empirical research on the use of quantity discounts for price discrimination. Using store-level sales data, the authors estimate a structural demand model, accounting for parameter heterogeneity and price endogeneity. They combine the parameter estimates with a model of retailer pricing to conduct optimal pricing and profitability simulations under several scenarios, ranging from constraining the retailer not to engage in any form of price discrimination to the least restrictive scenario of setting nonlinear price schedules specific to each store. The pricing simulations enable the decomposition of profitability as a result of the different forms of price discrimination. Profits are greatest when retailers combine second- and third-degree price discrimination. The authors find that the ability to engage in second-degree price discrimination contributes more to retailer profitability than does third-degree price discrimination.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.516","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses solely on price discrimination mechanisms and retailer profitability without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Although increasing server capacity may improve response time, the resources needed to do so are clearly not free. In this study, we propose a scheme that can improve a server's performance with no more than its current capacity. This scheme is based on priority processing, where the priority assigned to a customer depends on the potential revenue that is likely to be generated from the customer. The results for single-period analysis show that the benefit from priority processing increases as the server becomes more heavily utilized. We have also modeled a multiperiod version of the problem, where the demand in a period depends on the quality of service (QoS) that buyers receive in the previous period. In the multiperiod problem, both the server capacity and the processing policy in each period are determined optimally. Here, it may be optimal for the retailer to sacrifice profit and increase QoS in initial periods in order to increase demand (and revenue) in later periods. Thus, the processing policy of the server evolves from an emphasis on QoS in initial periods, to one on profit in subsequent periods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0044","","JOC","Information Systems","3","['quality of service', 'customer', 'revenue']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of server performance and profit optimization, with only a minor mention of quality of service (QoS) that could relate to customer experience.

We provide error analyses for our numerical solution based on the trapezoid-like rule for Stieltjes integrals and describe computational experience with two solution algorithms based on the trapezoid-like and the Simpson-like rules for Stieltjes integrals. We discuss a link between discrete and continuous renewal theory that is illuminated by the numerical solution method. The proposed numerical method is simple, amenable to direct error analysis, performs better than previously proposed approximations in many cases of significant practical interest, and is capable of handling some cases on which other methods fail.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0054","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of numerical methods for solving integral equations without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of wokeness."],["2005","17","1","Martin W.

Many of these approximation algorithms have been inspired by polyhedral formulations of the scheduling problems and their use in computing optimal solutions to small instances. In this paper we demonstrate that the progress in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for these problems also yields techniques with improved computational efficacy. Specifically, we give a comprehensive experimental study of a number of these approximation algorithms for 1|rj\u2211wjCj, the problem of scheduling jobs with release dates on one machine so as to minimize the average weighted completion time of the jobs scheduled. We study both the quality of lower bounds given for this problem by different linear-programming relaxations and combinatorial relaxations, and the quality of upper bounds delivered by a number of approximation algorithms based on them. The best algorithms, on almost all instances, come within a few percent of the optimal average weighted completion time. Furthermore, we show that this can usually be achieved with O(n log n) computation. In addition we observe that on most kinds of synthetic data used in experimental studies a simple greedy heuristic, used in successful combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithms for the problem, outperforms (on average) all of the LP-based heuristics. We identify, however, other classes of problems on which the LP-based heuristics are superior and report on experiments that give a qualitative sense of the range of dominance of each. We consider the impact of local improvement on the solutions as well. We also consider the performance of the algorithms for the average weighted flow-time criterion, which, although equivalent to average weighted completion time at optimality, is provably much harder to approximate. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that for most instances we consider that the algorithms give very good results for this criterion as well. Finally, we extend the techniques to a rather different and more complex problem that arises from an actual manufacturing application: resource-constrained project scheduling. In this setting as well, the techniques yield algorithms with improved performance; we give the best-known solutions for a set of instances provided by BASF AG, Germany.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0055","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of approximation algorithms for scheduling problems with no mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

To this end, distributed model predictive control (MPC) divides the task of operating a dynamic network into a set of small, localized subtasks, one for each distributed control agent. To guide the decomposition of the overall task, which plays a central role in the quality of the operation yielded by the distributed agents, this paper proposes a model for problem decomposition based on the design of agent communication networks. The model gives rise to the communication-network design problem: A bicriteria optimization problem whose objectives are the maximization of the influence perceived by the agents and the minimization of the communication cost. The benefit of the model is the potential to concentrate the effort of implementing distributed MPC, and measuring its actual performance, on a reduced number of decompositions, namely those that are Pareto efficient for the model. The paper gives an account of related work, including the computational complexity of finding Pareto efficient solutions, an integer programming formulation, and families of valid inequalities. Its main contribution is the demonstration that the model can be effective, meaning that Pareto efficient solutions to the model tend to induce efficient problem decompositions. The experimental evidence was gathered by applying the model to decompose control problems of two representative networks, namely arrays of pendulums and electric power networks, and measuring the quality of the operation delivered by the distributed control agents.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0056","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network control and optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

GRASP is a multistart metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization. It usually consists of a construction procedure based on a greedy randomized algorithm and of a local search. Path relinking is an intensification strategy that explores trajectories that connect high-quality solutions. Several variants of the heuristic are proposed and tested. Computational results show clearly that this GRASP for AP3 benefits from path relinking and that the variants considered in this paper compare well with previously proposed heuristics for this problem. GRASP with path relinking was able to improve the solution quality of heuristics proposed by Balas and Saltzman (1991), Burkard et al.

We show that the random variable \u201ctime to target solution,\u201d for all proposed GRASP with path-relinking variants, fits a two-parameter exponential distribution. To illustrate the consequence of this, one of the variants of GRASP with path relinking is shown to benefit from parallelization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0059","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

From the dual standpoint, column-generation processes can be viewed as cutting plane algorithms. In this paper, we present conditions under which it is possible to restrict the dual space, but still preserve the strength of the primal model and recover an optimal primal solution. We derive a family of dual cuts that are valid for the space of dual optimal solutions of the one-dimensional cutting-stock problem. These cuts correspond to extra columns in the primal model. Inserting a polynomial number of cuts of this family in the problem formulation at initialization time restricts the dual space during the entire column-generation process. Computational experiments show that this idea helps, reducing substantially the number of columns generated, the number of degenerate iterations, and the computational time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0060","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of column generation in linear programming without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The scheme is intended to shift demand during congestion periods to periods of lower demand by offering price discounts as an incentive to users to delay service during the high-demand periods. The price-discount offers act as a congestion-avoidance scheme that also balances communication traffic across different time periods. To get the scheme to work, we provide methods to evaluate when to offer the discounting scheme, estimate what proportion of customers accept the discounts, and how much the price discounts should be. In addition to offering a novel pricing structure, we show the optimal solution to the problem can be computed in a sequential manner from one period to the next, greatly simplifying implementation. Furthermore, we develop the model under uncertainty to emphasize the key implementation features of simple computations that can be performed in real time using sampled information online.

The VI is still treated as a convex feasibility problem, with linear cuts progressively shrinking a localization set that contains the solution of the VI. However, a quadratic cut is used to improve the positioning of the point at which the next cut will be generated. Our approach uses quadratic, ellipsoidal cuts, based on the symmetrized Jacobian of the VI. Since it cannot be guaranteed that such quadratic cuts do not cut off the solution of the VI, they are used only for direction, and are not integrated as such in the localization set; only the linear part of the quadratic cuts can safely be added to the localization set. The introduction of the quadratic cut together with the drop of the quadratic part of the previous cut is studied carefully. Numerical results are given that illustrate the substantial improvement that quadratic cuts can yield over linear cuts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0065","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for solving variational inequalities without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring low on the 'woke' scale."],["2005","17","2","Vardges MelkonianVardges Melkonianvardges@math.ohiou.eduDepartment of Mathematics, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, USASearch for more papers by this author, \u00c9va Tardos\u00c9va Tardoseva@cs.cornell.eduDepartment of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USASearch for more papers by this author","Primal-Dual-Based Algorithms for a Directed Network Design Problem","We present efficient algorithms for a special case of network design problems, the strong-connectivity problem.

One important function of workflow management is role resolution, i.e., the mechanism of assigning tasks to individual workers at runtime according to the role qualification defined in the workflow model. Role-resolution decisions directly affect the productivity of workers in an organization, and consequently affect corporate profitability. Therefore it is important to develop effective policies governing these decisions. However, there has not been a formal treatment of role-resolution policies in the literature. In this paper, we analyze role-resolution policies used in current workflow practice and propose new optimization-based policies that utilize online batching. Through a computational study, we examine three workflow-performance measures including maximum flowtime, average workload, and workload variation under these policies in different business scenarios. These scenarios vary by overall system load, task-processing-time distribution, and the number of workers. Based on computational results, we obtain the following insights that can help guide the selection of role-resolution policies. (a) As the overall system load increases, the benefit of using batching-based online optimization policies becomes more significant. (b) Processing-time variation has a major impact on workflow performance, and higher variation favors optimization-based policies.

Unlike other classical problems, the approach based on stating a suitable integer linear program and solving the associated linear-programming relaxation seems to be useless in this case. This makes it nontrivial to design algorithms capable of solving to optimality instances of reasonable size. In this paper, we illustrate a new simple lower bound on the optimal bandwidth and its extension within an enumerative algorithm, leading to integer linear-programming relaxations that can be solved efficiently and provide effective lower bounds if part of the layout is fixed. Keeping the integrality constraints in these relaxations is essential for this purpose. We show that the resulting method can solve to proven optimality 24 out of the 30 instances from the literature with less than 200 nodes, each in less than a minute on a personal computer. The new approach is also analyzed on randomly generated instances with up to 1,000 nodes. Moreover, we propose a method to compute the well-known density lower bound on the optimal bandwidth, which succeeds in finding this bound within minutes for most instances in the literature with up to 250 nodes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0083","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem in graph theory with no mention of socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Furthermore, we provide a research agenda listing problems in the design of simulation experiments\u2014as opposed to real-world experiments\u2014that require more investigation. We consider three types of practical problems: (1) developing a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system, (2) finding robust decisions or policies as opposed to so-called optimal solutions, and (3) comparing the merits of various decisions or policies. Our discussion emphasizes aspects that are typical for simulation, such as having many more factors than in real-world experiments, and the sequential nature of the data collection. Because the same problem type may be addressed through different design types, we discuss quality attributes of designs, such as the ease of design construction, the flexibility for analysis, and efficiency considerations. Moreover, the selection of the design type depends on the metamodel (response surface) that the analysts tentatively assume; for example, complicated metamodels require more simulation runs. We present several procedures to validate the metamodel estimated from a specific design, and we summarize a case study illustrating several of our major themes. We conclude with a discussion of areas that merit more work to achieve the potential benefits\u2014either via new research or incorporation into standard simulation or statistical packages.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1050.0136","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of simulation design and statistical theory without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

The need to predict to which class a particular data point belongs has been seen in areas such as medical diagnosis, credit rating, Web filtering, prediction, and stock rating. This has led to strong interest in developing systems that can accurately classify data and predict outcome. The classification is typically based on the feature values of objects being classified. Often, a form of ordering relation, defined by feature values, on the objects to be classified is known. For instance, the objects belonging to one class have larger (or smaller) feature values than do those in the other class. Exploiting this characteristic of isotonicity, we propose a data-classification method called isotonic separation based on linear programming, especially network programming. The paper also addresses an extension of the isotonic-separation method for continuous outcome prediction. Applications of the isotonic separation for discrete outcome prediction and its extension for continuous outcome prediction are shown to illustrate its applicability.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1030.0061","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data classification and prediction without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Many well-known heuristics can be embedded within the SGHC algorithm framework, including simulated annealing, pure local search, and threshold accepting (among others). SGHC algorithms probabilistically move between a set of related discrete optimization problems during their execution according to a problem probability mass function. When an SGHC algorithm moves between discrete optimization problems, information gained while optimizing the current problem is used to set the initial solution in the subsequent problem. The information used is determined by the practitioner for the particular set of problems under study. However, effective strategies are often apparent based on the problem description. SGHC algorithms are motivated by a discrete manufacturing process design optimization problem (that is used throughout the paper to illustrate the concepts needed to implement a SGHC algorithm). This paper discusses effective strategies for three examples of sets of related discrete optimization problems (a set of traveling salesman problems, a set of permutation flow shop problems, and a set of MAX 3-satisfiability problems). Computational results using the SGHC algorithm for randomly generated problems for two of these examples are presented. For comparison purposes, the associated generalized hill-climbing (GHC) algorithms are applied to the individual discrete optimization problems in the sets. These computational results suggest that near-optimal solutions can be reached more effectively and efficiently using SGHC algorithms.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0064","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization algorithms without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

A major stumbling block to the widespread use of combinatorial auctions is the complexity of the winner-determination problem, which is known to be NP-complete. We consider a rich version of combinatorial auctions, rule-based combinatorial auctions, where bids consist of rules that describe acceptable bundles rather than provide complete enumerations of acceptable bundles. This makes the winner-determination problem potentially harder because the problem must find bundles meeting bid criterion as well as finding an optimal selection of winning bids. This paper describes in detail a heuristic that achieves a satisfying solution to the winner-determination problem for large problems where exact solutions may not be attainable. Our contribution is threefold. First, we give a general approach to providing good approximations to the winner-determination problem for rule-based auctions. Although the approach requires adaptation for specific instances, it is conceptually tractable and implementable. Second, the approach is illustrated and tested on an auction format for selling prime-time television advertising time formed from data and interviews with industry sources. Third, while some researchers have used commercial solvers that appeared to obviate the need for specialized solution approaches to the winner-determination problem, we give evidence that, at least for the problem studied here, specialized approaches are necessary.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1040.0072","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical solution to a specific problem in combinatorial auctions without addressing any social issues, ethics, or diversity themes.

Using a knowledge-based framework, I propose that the ability to transfer knowledge and competencies across national boundaries is much easier in plants characterized by physical capital investment. Hence, during overseas entry, manufacturing firms are likely to use greenfield operations. On the other hand, in plants characterized by human capital investment, the difficulty in transferring knowledge and the need to learn and adapt to host nation requirements will make a local acquisition the preferred mode of entry by manufacturing firms. Using 682 entry decisions made by manufacturing firms during entry into the U.S., I investigate this notion while controlling for size of the industry, research intensity of the industry, degree of unionization, cultural distance, and the value of investment. Study findings indicate that in plants characterized by human capital intensity, the preferred entry mode is acquisitions over greenfield operations. However, foreign entrants with physical capital-intensive plants prefer greenfield operations over acquisitions.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.10.003","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on strategic decisions related to manufacturing firms' entry modes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although volunteers work alongside or in some cases replace employees in the delivery of service, incorporating volunteer labor into the service delivery system of the not-for-profit poses unique challenges. Understanding these challenges represents an important foundation-building step in understanding the implications for service design and service operations when using volunteers. This paper identifies and describes service design and operational factors relevant to volunteer satisfaction in not-for-profit organizations. Using data collected from 288 volunteers working in 43 not-for-profit agencies, the study explores the elements of service delivery that impact volunteer satisfaction, and further tests the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and loyalty to the not-for-profit organization. Findings include that satisfied volunteers are more likely to remain for longer periods of time with the same organization, are more likely to donate financially to the not-for-profit, and are more likely to recommend the volunteer experience to others. Each of these outcomes helps to ensure the continued sustainability of the not-for-profit organization.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.003","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['volunteers', 'not-for-profit', 'sustainability', 'service delivery', 'satisfaction']","The article discusses the role of volunteers in not-for-profit organizations and emphasizes sustainability and volunteer satisfaction, indicating moderate social responsibility themes.

Our approach employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) models. A series of experiments are conducted with the proposed model by varying the levels of system-wide efficiency, resource reallocation, and budget in generating a set of decisions that executive management of the agency can implement. In addition, we investigate service channel management issues that the agency is currently facing in providing the services by web, phone, facsimile, and mail in addition to branch offices.

This paper reports the result of an empirical study comparing application of service management principles in one public sector area, further education (FE) colleges, with private sector service organizations. Although within our sample marked differences exist between the levels of service drivers and outcomes, our findings suggest that the same management model is applicable to both sectors. Based on a sample of 291 service organizations, we demonstrate that a managerial model, represented by the service profit chain, is valid in both our FE college and private sector sample. Specifically, progressive human resource management practices led to employee satisfaction, which in turn impacted both service quality and customer satisfaction in both the public and private organizations. The results indicate that the performance of FE colleges arose in part from the managerial choices made in adoption of practices, and that it is lack of employee focus that may be holding back performance. Relevant to both public and private sectors is that the research indicates that human resource factors have a stronger impact than quality procedures, on both service quality and customer satisfaction.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.005","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['human resource management', 'employee satisfaction', 'service quality']","The article discusses human resource management practices and their impact on employee satisfaction and service quality, indicating a moderate focus on ethical organizational practices.

Quality management practices provide the unit of analysis for studying this linkage. The theory of organizational publicness is used to establish that organizations can be defined on a continuum of publicness rather than as purely public or purely private. Particular cultural factors, political influences, and organizational characteristics define this publicness. The study investigates the linkage between four publicness dimensions (ownership, goal setting, funding, and control) and operations-related quality practices (information and analysis, staff focus, and process management) in U.S. hospitals. The results of regression analysis show that the publicness dimensions of ownership and control are related to some quality management practices, with control (i.e. public responsibility and compliance) having a significant effect throughout the studied models. Hospital goal setting and funding, two additional publicness dimensions, are not significantly related to quality management practices. The results of this study build our understanding of how operations practices are used in public organizations and help to define the extent to which publicness matters.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.007","","JOM","Operations Management","5","['publicness', 'quality management', 'public responsibility', 'compliance']","The article discusses the concept of 'publicness' and its relationship to quality management practices in hospitals, indicating a moderate focus on social responsibility and ethical considerations in operations management.

The reality is that the not-for-profit is a far more complex organization that is responsible to diverse groups of stakeholders. Unlike for-profit organizations, not-for-profit (NFP) organizations have to focus on dual, and often conflicting, goals relating to fulfilling their overall mission while also generating enough revenue to maintain their operating structures. In order to better understand the nature of the dual orientation of the NFP organization, the behavior of Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) patrons using the CSO website is viewed. Specifically, this study examines data for individuals purchasing CSO concert tickets on-line during an 8-month period in 2000\u20132001. MANOVA and ANOVA statistical procedures are used to analyze the effects of both the economic and mission related orientations operationalized through the e-service encounter. Further, we view data from the on-line ticketing function relative to the labor costs of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.008","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['not-for-profit', 'altruistic', 'stakeholders', 'mission']","The article discusses the complexities of not-for-profit organizations and their responsibilities to diverse stakeholders, indicating a moderate focus on social impact and mission-driven objectives.

Uncertainty and welfare economics of medical care. The American Economic Review, 5, 941\u2013973]. For-profit healthcare entities face an inherent conflict between providing profits to investors and health welfare to patients. Thus, non-profit entities exist as a signal and evidence of higher quality services. To date, research examining differences in quality between for-profit and non-profit nursing homes has focused on a direct link between outcome quality and non-profit status. These studies have produced inconclusive or mixed results. We argue that non-profit or for-profit status and outcome quality are linked via two intermediate factors, namely process quality and input quality. Consistent with many prior studies, we report no direct link between non-profit status and outcome quality. However, we report that process quality is indeed higher at non-profit nursing homes than for-profit nursing homes, but that input quality is lower. We also examine the association between outcome quality with process and input quality. We report that different aspects of process quality are tied to better outcome quality, but report several notable exceptions. This research provides support for Arrow's hypothesis at the process level and gives insights into the link between process quality, input quality and outcome quality in the nursing home environment.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.004","","JOM","Operations Management","4","['non-profit', 'for-profit', 'quality', 'health welfare']","The article examines the differences in quality of care between non-profit and for-profit nursing homes, highlighting the conflict between profit motives and patient welfare.

Prior research has indicated that the integration of material suppliers into the new product development (NPD) cycle can provide substantial benefits towards achieving these goals. This involvement may range from simple consultation with suppliers on design ideas to making suppliers fully responsible for the design of components or systems they will supply. Moreover, suppliers may be involved at different stages of the new product development process. Early supplier involvement is a key coordinating process in supply chain design, product design and process design.\n            \n            Several important questions regarding supplier involvement in new product development remain unanswered. Specifically, we look at the issue of what managerial practices affect new product development team effectiveness when suppliers are to be involved. We also consider whether these factors differ depending on when the supplier is to be involved and what level of responsibility is to be given to the supplier. Finally, we examine whether supplier involvement in new product development can produce significant improvements in financial returns and/or product design performance. We test these proposed relationships using survey data collected from a group of global organizations and find support for the relationships based on the results of a multiple regression analysis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.009","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['supplier involvement', 'new product development', 'managerial practices']","The article primarily focuses on operational efficiency and financial returns related to supplier integration in product development, with little emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Dependencies among decisions across these domains make this competitive situation very complex. To address this complexity, three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3D-CE) has been suggested ([Fine, C.H., 1998. Clockspeed\u2014Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, Reading, MA.]). Applying 3D-CE requires an operationalization of one of its core elements: the product architecture. In this paper, I develop a multi-dimensional framework that enables comprehensive product architecture assessments. The framework builds on existing product characteristic concepts such as component commonality, product platforms, and product modularity. The framework's utility is illustrated with two example products, showing how individual product architecture dimensions link decisions across different domains. This framework can be used to focus advice for product design on product architecture dimensions that are critical for a given operational strategy, to assess advantages and limitations of operational strategies in conjunction with given product architectures, or to develop dynamic capabilities such as planning effective product\u2013operation strategy combinations.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.006","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product architecture and operational strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically, this paper considers the specific scenario of optimizing the configuration of the supply chain system given commonality among platform products. The paper uses and extends the concept of Generic Bills of Materials (GBOM) of a product family as a unified framework for qualitatively capturing and representing the structure of its supply chain. This qualitative model is then enhanced by a mathematical model developed to quantify the relationships among various design decisions. Endeavoring to solve the mathematical model more efficiently, we propose an effective heuristic method using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Although GA generally does not guarantee the optimal solution, the best heuristic solutions obtained in this study are consistent with the optimal solutions obtained using Dynamic Programming. The resulting mathematical model and solution algorithm are then used to investigate the mutual impact between the design decisions of platform products and of processes in the supply chain through sensitivity analyses.

The following two questions serve as the motivation for the study: Do customer expectations of order fulfillment processes vary across product types? Should the product type matter in configuring order fulfillment processes? From the studies in the marketing literature, we infer that customer satisfaction assessments are based on customer expectations of order fulfillment processes, and that these expectations systematically vary across the three product types: convenience goods (e.g., groceries, home and office supplies), shopping goods (e.g., ready-to-wear men, women, and kids\u2019 apparel), and specialty goods (e.g., desktop and notebook computers, and wedding dresses). In particular, we posit that ceteris paribus, customer satisfaction with order fulfillment will decrease moving along a continuum of product types, from convenience goods to specialty goods. The empirical analysis for this study is based on data collected on dimensions of customer satisfaction with order fulfillment from a sample of 256 firms engaged in electronic B2C transactions. Firms included in our study sample are such that their products can be classified into only one of three product types: convenience, shopping, or specialty goods. In essence, each firm in the study sample is a proxy for one of three product types. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that, on average, customers tend to have higher satisfaction levels with the order fulfillment process of convenience and shopping goods than with the order fulfillment process of specialty goods.

The revised structures often involve delaying the delivery of the products until after the customer orders arrive, termed time postponement (TP), or delaying the differentiation of the products until later production stages, termed form postponement (FP). We develop models representing possible implementations of the TP and FP structures and compare their performance in total supply chain cost and expected customer waiting times. We find that once the number of different products increases above some threshold level, the TP structure is preferred under both performance metrics.\n            \n            For the most general model, a numerical experiment was designed to investigate how different factors affect the performance of the TP and FP structures. Through this experiment we show that higher arrival time and process time variations make the FP structure more favorable while increases in the number of products and higher interest rates make the TP structure more favorable. We also offer guidance to managers using either structure on where to allocate resources for performance improvement. For example, to improve the customer waiting times under the FP structure, increasing the coverage of the generic component and reducing the number of products provide larger benefits than reducing the variability of the arrival and process times.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.10.016","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['diverse', 'customer demands', 'supply chain']","The article discusses supply chain structures in relation to customer demands for diverse product offerings, but it primarily focuses on technical aspects and performance metrics rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

The growing number of articles on BOSC in the literature is an indication of the importance of the strategy and of its role in improving the competitiveness of an organization. The objective of a BOSC strategy is to meet the requirements of individual customers by leveraging the advantages of outsourcing and information technology. There are not many research articles that provide an overview of BOSC, despite the fact that this strategy is being promoted as the operations paradigm of the future. The main objective of this research is to (i) review the concepts of BOSC, (ii) develop definitions of BOSC, (iii) classify the literature based on a suitable classification scheme, leading to some useful insights into BOSC and some future research directions, (iv) review the selected articles on BOSC for their contribution to the development and operations of BOSC, (v) develop a framework for BOSC, and (vi) suggest some future research directions. The literature has been reviewed based on the following four major areas of decision-making: organizational competitiveness, the development and implementation of BOSC, the operations of BOSC, and information technology in BOSC. Some of the important observations are: (a) there is a lack of adequate research on the design and control of BOSC, (b) there is a need for further research on the implementation of BOSC, (c) human resource issues in BOSC have been ignored, (d) issues of product commonality and modularity from the perspective of partnership or supplier development require further attention and (e) the trade-off between responsiveness and the cost of logistics needs further study.

We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to study the effect of offering price incentives to those customers who are willing to commit themselves to purchasing the cheaper-to-produce standardized product. The market\u2019s reaction to price incentives is captured by modeling the probabilistic behavior of two exclusive groups of customers who may be \u201cprice-sensitive\u201d or \u201cprice-insensitive\u201d and who are willing to commit themselves. We develop an analytic expression for the distribution of the demand for the BOP conditional on the actual number of committed demands for SP following the price-incentive announcement. We show that price incentives expand the total expected demand while reducing demand uncertainty and we present conditions under which it is optimal to offer a price incentive. Sequentially made price incentive and capacity decisions for the BOP that maximize expected profit are obtained by solving the dynamic programming problem. We provide a comparative statics analysis and examine the effect of varying parameter values on the optimal price-incentive discount rate. We also describe a numerical study and present a sensitivity analysis of the profit improvement obtained after offering price incentives. We show that for low purchase probability, large number of customers in the price-sensitive group and high profit margin price incentives can substantially improve the expected profit.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.10.008","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and demand modeling without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Derived from successes in other industries, the benefits of responsive supply systems capable of providing customized vehicles in short lead-times have been pointed out. While the theoretical discussion of such \u2018build-to-order\u2019 (BTO) strategies is well advanced, the dynamic feasibility of implementing these concepts is far from understood. Using a simulation of a multi-tier supply chain-system, this paper investigates the impact of altering key aspects of the scheduling activities with the objective of determining the scope for potential improvements in responsiveness of the supply chain. The simulation results show that current vehicle supply systems are not capable of supporting BTO due to insufficient feedback between supply and demand, as well as due to the strong reliance on forecasting in the scheduling process. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how to improve current scheduling systems towards increasing the content of vehicles built to customer order.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.10.009","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of automotive scheduling systems and supply chain efficiency without addressing any themes related to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

From several enablers of AM, virtual enterprise (VE) and information technology (IT) were chosen. This empirical study explored the impact of the alignment between VE and IT on business performance in an AM setting. Extensive data collection strategy and several tests are used to establish the reliability and validity of the data collected. Extensive analyses of the data using structural equation molding were performed for five hypotheses. The results indicate that both VE and IT had positive influences on business performance. It was also established that the alignment between VE and IT had a positive impact on business performance. Further, it was shown that the impact of the alignment between VE and IT on business performance was more significant than the impact of VE and IT on business performance individually.

The firm will see an increase in demand, but face some operational difficulties. One of these is related to the return policy which is now a recognized tool to win customer orders. This is even more true for increasingly popular Internet sales where the opportunity to physically examine the product is absent. A tremendous advantage can be gained by the Internet firm if it could offer a return policy for BTO products. We propose the use of modularity in the product design as a solution to this problem. From manufacturer's point of view, following a policy of modularization and offering a generous return policy would increase revenue, but also increase the cost due to increased likelihood of return and increased cost of design. We develop a profit maximization model to jointly obtain optimal polices for return policy and modularity level in terms of certain market reaction parameters. We obtain a number of managerial guidelines for using marketing and operational strategy variables to influence those reaction parameters so as to obtain the maximum benefit from the market.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.10.012","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational strategies and profit maximization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Our research context is the full-service restaurant table mix problem. This problem, which is quite new to the literature, finds the optimal number of different size tables for a restaurant to maximize its value (revenue or contribution) generating potential. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of eight heuristic techniques for the problem using two experiments. The first experiment uses data from a 240-seat full-service restaurant to evaluate all eight heuristics, while the second experiment investigates the performance of selected heuristics under a broader set of environmental factors. The results of our first experiment showed that the better of the simulated annealing heuristic variants yielded the optimal solution in seven of eight test problems, averaging within 0.1% of optimal. Our second experiment showed that the simplest of the models we investigated yielded solutions within 1% of the simulated annealing solution. Finally, we observed that altering the table mix on a daily basis increased performance by over 1% compared to maintaining the optimal weekly table mix.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.07.010","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical methods for optimizing revenue in restaurants without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1."],["2005","23","6","Funda Sahin,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Funda Sahin\n                     \n                        fsahin@utk.edu\n                     \n                     University of Tennessee, College of Business, Department of Marketing and Logistics, 310 Stokely Management Center, Knoxville, TN 37996-0530, USACorresponding author.Search for more papers by this authorE.

We mathematically model and develop simulation-based rolling schedule procedures for analyzing the manufacturer's ordering policies, transportation activities, and the vendor's manufacturing and order fulfillment processes under five alternative integration strategies. Our objective is to measure the value of information sharing and system coordination across the strategies, identify whether the source of the benefits come from information sharing or coordination, study the allocation of system benefits among channel members, and analyze the impact of environmental factors on system cost performance. The experimental results indicate a 47.58% cost reduction moving from a traditional supply chain to a fully integrated system. While information sharing reduces costs, the main economic benefit comes from coordinated decision-making. The savings associated with system integration are not equally allocated among channel members, and vary by strategy. The procedures developed in the research provide economic insight that fosters the sharing of technological and strategic efforts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.007","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['information sharing', 'coordination', 'cost reduction']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain management, emphasizing cost reduction and efficiency rather than social justice or ethical considerations.

Each grocer follows a different operations strategy as determined by choice of where to fulfill customer orders (from existing stores or from a dedicated DC) and by choice of delivery method (direct to the customer's home/office or indirect via customer pickup or third-party logistics provider). The survey data from customers are used to assess the degree of integration between marketing and operations and the relationship with customer behavioral intentions. The results indicate that eBusiness-, product-, and service-quality, all have a significant direct effect on customer behavioral intentions to purchase again. There is limited support for technology as a moderating factor. Finally, the relationships between the predictor variables and customer behavioral intentions differ across grocers. This supports the idea that grocers utilizing different operational strategies should focus attention on different facets of their business and provides insight as to where efforts should be directed.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.01.003","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['operations strategy', 'customer behavioral intentions', 'eBusiness']","The article focuses primarily on operational strategies and customer behavior without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Based on the literature and a case study we identified two stages in implementing ISO 9000\u2014(1) Installation, which has two dimensions: (a) external coordination and (b) integration; and (2) Usage, which also has two dimensions: (a) in daily practice and (b) as a catalyst for change. The hypotheses were that installation of ISO 9000 is positively related to use of ISO 9000, and use of ISO 9000 is positively related to operating performance. In addition, use of ISO 9000 is positively related to business performance since operating performance is positively related to business performance. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) to test our hypotheses and validated the results by comparing the longitudinal performance of ISO 9000 certified companies with four matched samples of companies that were not ISO 9000 certified. Our analysis indicated that while the installation stage was necessary to successfully implement ISO 9000, organizations achieved a distinct operating advantage from this replicable standard when they used it in daily practice and as a catalyst for change. These findings were based on responses to a survey of 1150 quality managers in 924 organizations, which was supplemented for about one-third of the organizations with longitudinal information from the Compustat database on the organizations\u2019 business and operating performance. The validation indicated that implementing the ISO 9000 standard led to improved operating performance, but that this outcome did not necessarily or automatically yield better business performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jom.2005.01.004","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of implementing ISO 9000 and its impact on business performance, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2005","24","1","Zhaohui Wu,\u00a0\n                     Corresponding Author\n                     Zhaohui Wu\n                     \n                        Zhaohui.Wu@bus.oregonstate.edu\n                     \n                     Department of Management, College of Business, Oregon State University, 200 Bexell Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331-2603, USACorresponding author.Search for more papers by this authorThomas Y.

This research defines the changing role of design engineers, and it discusses their impact on setting clear project targets and sharing knowledge about customers. The study investigates the impact of these variables on product development productivity. Data collected from 205 manufacturing firms were used to create valid and reliable instruments to assess role change of design engineers, clarity of project targets, shared knowledge about customers and product development productivity. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that as the role of design engineers expands the clarity of project targets increase. This increase impacts the extent of shared knowledge about customers.

Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge.  This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems.  We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation.  Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities.\n\nThrough an exploratory field study conducted in the context of the RosettaNet consortium effort in the IT industry supply chain, we use cluster analysis to uncover and characterize five supply chain partnership configurations (collectors, connectors, crunchers, coercers, and collaborators).  We compare their partner-enabled knowledge creation and operational efficiency, as well as the shortcomings in their capability platforms and the nature of information exchange.  Through the characterization of each of the configurations, we are able to derive research propositions focused on enterprise absorptive capacity elements.  These propositions provide insight into how partner-enabled market knowledge creation and operational efficiency can be affected, and highlight the interconnected roles of coordination information and rich information.

For such systems, firms typically use consultants to aid in the implementation process.  Client firms expect consultants to transfer their implementation knowledge to their employees so that they can contribute to successful implementations and learn to maintain the systems independent of the consultants.  This study examines the antecedents of knowledge transfer in the context of such an interfirm complex information systems implementation environment.  Drawing from the knowledge transfer, information systems, and communication literatures, an integrated theoretical model is developed that posits that knowledge transfer is influenced by knowledge-related, motivational, and communication-related factors.  Data were collected from consultant-and-client matched-pair samples from 96 ERP implementation projects.  Unlike most prior studies, a behavioral measure of knowledge transfer that incorporates the application of knowledge was used.  The analysis suggests that all three groups of factors influence knowledge transfer, and provides support for 9 of the 13 hypotheses. The analysis also confirms two mediating relationships.  These results (1) adapt prior research, primarily done in non-IS contexts, to the ERP implementation context, (2) enhance prior findings by confirming the significance of an antecedent that has previously shown mixed results, and (3) incorporate new IS-related constructs and measures in developing an integrated model that should be broadly applicable to the interfirm IS implementation context and other IS situations.

A large number of KM initiatives fail due to the reluctance of employees to share knowledge through these systems.  Motivated by such concerns, this study formulates and tests a theoretical model to explain EKR usage by knowledge contributors.  The model employs social exchange theory to identify cost and benefit factors affecting EKR usage, and social capital theory to account for the moderating influence of contextual factors.  The model is validated through a large-scale survey of public sector organizations.  The results reveal that knowledge self-efficacy and enjoyment in helping others significantly impact EKR usage by knowledge contributors.  Contextual factors (generalized trust, pro-sharing norms, and identification) moderate the impact of codification effort, reciprocity, and organizational reward on EKR usage, respectively.  It can be seen that extrinsic benefits (reciprocity and organizational reward) impact EKR usage contingent on particular contextual factors whereas the effects of intrinsic benefits (knowledge self-efficacy and enjoyment in helping others) on EKR usage are not moderated by contextual factors.  The loss of knowledge power and image do not appear to impact EKR usage by knowledge contributors.

Our model prototype provides managers with a learning tool relating to the timing and selection of knowledge creation investments. Our own use of the tool in simulation experiments yielded several insights which suggest that the  decisions typically made by managers may dilute knowledge creation investments.  Our results demonstrate that the organizational benefit of knowledge creation processes should be well aligned with near-term tasks.

Activity theory provides a framework to study such a community:  members of an EIP conduct specific tasks that are assigned through a division of labor.  Each member of an enterprise information portal can undergo three distinct types of learning processes: learning-by-investment, learning-by-doing, and learning-from-others.  Through these three types of learning processes, each member achieves specialized knowledge that is related to his or her own task.  Cumulative knowledge resulting from the learning processes is considered in terms of two distinct attributes:  depth and breadth of knowledge.  This paper formulates a mathematical model and defines the goal of an EIP member as maximizing the net benefits of knowledge resulting from individual investment and effort.  Numerical examples are provided to analyze patterns of optimal investment and effort plans as well as the resulting accumulated knowledge.  The results provide useful managerial implications.  In business conditions characterized by high interest rates or high internal rate of returns, it is preferable for members to delay spending their resources for learning.  Intensive investment and efforts to obtain knowledge are preferable when the discount rate of costs is high, when knowledge is durable, when the value of knowledge is high, when the initial level of knowledge is high, when the productivity of the learning process is high, and when sufficient knowledge is transferred from other members.  On the other hand, the size of the EIP has a positive or negative effect depending on the attribute of knowledge and the productivity of learning processes.

We first assessed extant models of resistance to IT.  Using semantic analysis, we identified five basic components of resistance:  behaviors, object, subject, threats, and initial conditions.  We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel nature of the phenomenon.  Using analytic induction, we examined data from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations in hospital settings, focusing on physicians\u2019 resistance behaviors.  The resulting mixed-determinants model suggests that group resistance behaviors vary during implementation.  When a system is introduced, users in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions.  They then make projections about the consequences of its use.  If expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result.  During implementation,  should some trigger occur to either modify or activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the group and other user groups, it will also modify the object of resistance, from system to system significance.  If the relevant initial conditions pertain to the power of the resisting group vis-\u00e0-vis the system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from system significance to system advocates.  Resistance behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object of resistance and initial conditions.  We also found that the bottom-up process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation.  In early implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described as a combination of independent, individual behaviors.  In later stages of implementation, if group level initial conditions have become active, the emergence process is one of composition, described as the convergence of individual behaviors.","https://misq.umn.edu/a-multilevel-model-of-resistance-to-information-technology-implementation.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['resistance', 'power', 'behaviors']","The article discusses resistance behaviors in the context of information technology implementation, touching on themes of power dynamics and group behaviors.

The paper builds on (1) information systems work that suggests that the effects of IT are best documented at the level of processes within a firm, (2) information systems work that suggests that the performance effects of IT are likely to be contingent in nature, and (3) developments in the resource-based view, which describes the kinds of IT resources and capabilities that are likely to enable a process in one firm to outperform the same process in competing firms.

Of particular interest to IS scholars, it is found that shared knowledge between IT and customer service units\u2014an important driver of how IT is implemented and used in the customer service process\u2014is a key IT capability that affects customer service process performance and moderates the impacts of explicit IT resources such as the generic information technologies used in the process and IT spending, which\u2014consistent with resource-based predictions\u2014were not found to be directly and positively associated with relative process performance.  The implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.","https://misq.umn.edu/information-technology-and-the-performance-of-the-customer-service-process-a-resource-based-analysis.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['customer service', 'IT resources', 'performance']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of IT and its impact on customer service performance, with no significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

While there is little question that clients should learn, there is less clarity about how best to facilitate client learning during developer-client meetings.  In this study, we suggest that a cooperative learning strategy called collaborative elaboration developed by educational psychologists provides a theoretical and practical basis for stimulating client learning during an IS design process. The problem with assessing the effects of collaborative elaboration, however, is in controlling for the many other factors that might affect client learning and outcomes of an IS design phase.  In a unique research opportunity, we were able to measure the use of collaborative elaboration among 85 developers and clients involved in 17 projects over a semester-long IS design process.  The projects were homogeneous with respect to key contextual variables.  Our PLS analysis suggested that teams using more collaborative elaboration had more client learning and teams with more client learning achieved better IS design-phase outcomes.  This suggests that theories about collaborative elaboration have significant potential for helping IS researchers identify new approaches for stimulating client learning early in the IS design process.","https://misq.umn.edu/managing-client-dialogues-during-information-systems-design-to-facilitate-client-learning.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['client learning', 'collaborative elaboration', 'cooperative learning']","The article discusses client learning and collaborative strategies, which touch on themes of cooperation and engagement in the design process.

In this article, we formally define the notion of IT-dependent strategic initiative and use it to frame a review of the literature on the sustain- ability of competitive advantage rooted in information systems use.  We offer a framework that articulates both the dynamic approach to IT-dependent strategic advantage currently receiving attention in the literature and the underlying drivers of sustainability.  This framework models how and why the characteristics of the IT-dependent strategic initiative enable sustained competitive advantage, and how the determinants of sustainability are developed and strengthened over time.  Such explanation facilitates the pre-implementation analysis of planned initiatives by innovators, as well as the post-implementation evaluation of existing initiatives so as to identify the basis of their sustainability.\n\nIn carrying out this study, we examined the interdisciplinary literature on strategic information systems.  Using a structured methodology, we reviewed the titles and abstracts of 648 articles drawn from information systems, strategic management, and marketing literature.  We then examined and individually coded a relevant subset of 117 articles.  The literature has identified four barriers to erosion of competitive advantage for IT-dependent strategic initiatives and has surfaced the structural determinants of their magnitude.  Previous work has also begun to theorize about the process by which these barriers to erosion evolve over time.  Our review reveals that significant exploratory research and theoretical development have occurred in this area, but there is a paucity of research providing rigorous tests of theoretical propositions.\n\nOur work makes three principal contributions.  First, it formalizes the definition of IT-dependent strategic initiative.  Second, it organizes the extant interdisciplinary research around an integrative framework that should prove useful to both research and practice.  This framework offers an explanation of how and why IT-dependent strategic initiatives contribute to sustained competitive advantage, and explains the process by which they evolve over time.  Finally, our review and analysis of the literature offers the basis for future research directions.","https://misq.umn.edu/review-it-dependent-strategic-initiatives-and-sustained-competitive-advantage-a-review-and-synthesis-of-the-literature.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['sustainability', 'competitive advantage', 'strategic initiative']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of IT-dependent strategic initiatives and competitive advantage without a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

Virtual reality (VR) on the Internet has been gaining prominence recently because it enables consumers to experience products realistically over the Internet, there by mitigating the problems associated with consumers\u2019 lack of physical contact with products. However, while the employment of VR has increased in B2C e-commerce, its impact has not been explored extensively by research in the IS field.\n\nThis study investigates whether and under what circumstances VR enhances consumer learning about products.  In general, VR enables consumers to learn about products thoroughly by providing high-quality three-dimensional images of products, interactivity with the products, and increased telepresence.  In addition, congruent with the theory of cognitive fit, the effects of VR are more pronounced when it exhibits products whose salient attributes are completely apparent through visual and auditory cues (because most VR on desktop computers uses only those two sensory modalities to deliver information).  Based on these attributes, we distinguish between two types of products\u2014namely, virtually high experiential (VHE) and virtually low experiential (VLE) products\u2014in terms of the sensory modalities that are used and required for product inspection.  Hypotheses arising from the distinctions expressed by these terms were tested via a laboratory experiment.  The results support the predictions that VR interfaces increase overall consumer learning about products and that these effects extend to VHE products more significantly than to VLE products.","https://misq.umn.edu/the-effects-of-virtual-learning-on-consumer-learning-an-empirical-investigation.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of virtual reality in consumer learning without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

To address the criticism that the original IS SERVQUAL\u2019s expectation measure is ambiguous, we test a new set of scales that posits that service expectations exist at two levels that IS customers use as a basis to  assess IS service quality:  (1) desired service:  the level of IS service desired, and (2) adequate service:  the minimum level of IS service customers are willing to accept.  Defining these two levels is a \u201czone of tolerance\u201d (ZOT) that represents the range of IS service performance a customer would consider satisfactory.  In other words, IS customer service expectations are characterized by a range of levels, rather than a single expectation point. This research note adapts the ZOT and the generic operational definition from marketing to the IS field, assessing its psychometric properties.  Our findings conclude that the instrument shows validity of a four-dimension IS ZOT SERVQUAL measure for desired, adequate, and perceived service quality levels, identifying 18 commonly applicable question items.

Our results indicate that all three factors driving marketing mix interactions are at play in this product category. The U.S. market is less price-sensitive than the European markets. Detailing elasticities are comparable across the United States, Germany, and Italy, while the United Kingdom and France show greater elasticity. For the U.S. market, we find that almost all deviations from Nash pricing and detailing levels are due to within-market interactions. In the U.K. market, deviations from Nash prices come about due mostly to across-market interactions\u2014both with the United States as well as the rest of Europe, whereas deviations from Nash detailing levels are mainly due to across-market interactions with the United States. For Italy, we observe that both within and across-market interactions affect price and detailing levels.

We argue that market conditions and company-specific characteristics do not suffice to explain incumbents' entry timing, but that entry is a contagious process. Our results demonstrate that incumbents are more likely to respond to innovations in their industry when their counterparts do so. In particular, we show that incumbents are affected by the entry of firms that are similar in size and resources. When a highly similar company enters the new market, it raises the probability that the company enters itself beyond levels based solely on the attractiveness of the market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0064","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market dynamics and competitive behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or diversity themes.

Using this last rationale as a starting point, we develop a series of research propositions related to key relationships where (a) insignificant or contradictory results have been obtained (in extant research) or (b) researchers have yet to delve. The propositions are designed to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the areas. Throughout the analysis, the key to developing the propositions is to recognize the importance of moderating factors, mediating factors, and covariates.

In three exploratory studies, we find evidence of managers' thinking about competitors' past and future behavior, but little incidence of strategic competitive reasoning. Competitive intelligence experts and other experienced managers' assessment of the results suggests that the relatively low incidence of strategic competitor reasoning is due to perceptions of low returns from anticipating competitor reactions more than to the high cost of doing so.

We first estimate demand functions for P&G and competitor brands from the period before value pricing was initiated. We then formulate a dynamic manufacturer-retailer Stackelberg model that includes P&G, a national-brand competitor, and a retailer. The model takes P&G's move as given and prescribes the price and promotion response of the competitors and the retailer. We substitute the estimated demand parameters into the model to obtain prescriptions for each competitor and the retailer, and see whether these prescriptions are related to the actual response. We find that the dynamic game-theoretic model calibrated with empirical estimates of demand parameters has significant predictive power. We also test the predictive power of two benchmark models. The first is based on the reaction function approach of Leeflang and Wittink (Leeflang, Peter S. H., Wittink, Dick R. 1992. Diagnosing competitive reactions using (aggregated) scanner data. Internat.

We believe this paradoxical situation exists because both advertising and promotion are necessary to compete effectively in dynamic markets. Consequently, brand managers need to account for interactions between marketing activities and interactions among competing brands. By recognizing interaction effects between activities, managers can consider interactivity trade-offs in planning the marketing-mix strategies. On the other hand, by recognizing interactions with competitors, managers can incorporate strategic foresight in their planning, which requires them to look forward and reason backward in making optimal decisions. Looking forward means that each brand manager anticipates how other competing brands are likely to make future decisions, and then by reasoning backward deduces one's own optimal decisions in response to the best decisions to be made by all other brands. The joint consideration of interaction effects and strategic foresight in planning marketing-mix strategies is a challenging and unsolved marketing problem, which motivates this paper.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0083","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing strategies and does not address any themes related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or social justice.

In this research note, we propose a new class of hierarchical dynamic Bayesian models for capturing such dynamic effects in conjoint applications, which extend the standard hierarchical Bayesian random effects and existing dynamic Bayesian models by allowing for individual-level heterogeneity around an aggregate dynamic trend. Using simulated conjoint data, we explore the performance of these new dynamic models, incorporating individual-level heterogeneity across a number of possible types of dynamic effects, and demonstrate the derived benefits versus static models.

Building on the notion that loss aversion is more pronounced when comparisons are explicit rather than implicit, we propose that the mere fact that consumers are explicitly told to make particular comparisons induces more risk-averse, cautious choice and bidding behavior. This proposition was supported in a field experiment involving real online auctions, in which comparisons among listings either were done spontaneously by bidders or were encouraged using an explicit instruction to compare the focal auction with adjacent listings. Results showed that explicit reference points (1) diminished the influence of adjacent auction prices on the focal auction\u2019s price; (2) led participants to submit fewer, lower, and later bids; (3) increased the incidence of sniping; (4) decreased bidding frenzy; and (5) decreased the tendency to bid on multiple items simultaneously. The impact of explicit comparisons on risk-averse behavior was further tested in a very different context using a laboratory choice experiment. In that study, explicit instructions to compare option sets increased the tendency to choose the compromise, low-risk, and all-average alternatives.

At first, this research appears consistent with firm practices. However, close scrutiny reveals disaffirming evidence. Many current so-called loyalty programs appear unrelated to the cultivation of customer brand loyalty and the creation of customer assets. True investments are up-front expenditures that produce much greater future returns. In contrast, many so-called loyalty programs are shams because they produce liabilities (e.g., promises of future rewards or deferred rebates) rather than assets. These programs produce short-term revenue from customers while producing substantial future obligations to those customers. Rather than showing trust by committing to the customer, the firm asks the customer to trust the firm\u2014that is, trust that future rewards are indeed forthcoming. The entire idea is antithetical to the concept of a customer asset. Many modern loyalty programs resemble old-fashioned trading stamps or deferred rebates that promise future benefits for current patronage. A true loyalty program invests in the customer (e.g., provides free up-front training, allows familiarization or customization) with the expectation of greater future revenue.

We compare our method with standard logistic regression, hierarchical Bayes, and the polyhedral methods using standard, widely used simulation data. The experiments show that the proposed method handles noise significantly better than both logistic regression and the recent polyhedral methods and is never worse than the best method among the three mentioned above. It can also be used for estimating nonlinearities in preference models faster and better than all other methods.

The procedure also enables the researcher to control both for the potential endogeneity of marketing variables as well as potential heterogeneity in consumer tastes. Using our aggregate estimates, we can measure the decomposition of price elasticities into incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity components. We also propose several empirical tests to assess the validity of the discrete/continuous demand system versus that of the logit model. In several simulation experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of this model across datasets in which quantity choices may or may not be important.

Under symmetric information we find that the optimal contracts have a nice property that allows managers to reach the upper bound on firms\u2019 profit by using either centralized or delegated pricing, and hence there are no incentive-based reasons to prefer centralized versus delegated contract types. Thus, managers can focus on the design of the optimal incentive scheme without worrying about the contract type. Under asymmetric information we find that there always exists an equilibrium where all firms use centralized pricing that is either unique or payoff equivalent to equilibria that have a combination of contract types. These results are robust to a large class of agent and market parameters.

We derive theoretically based propositions on the moderating effects of past customer behavior and conduct a longitudinal validation test to compare the performance of our model with that of commonly used segmentation models in predicting intermediate-term, customer-specific gross profit change. Our findings show that response to marketing interventions is highly heterogeneous, that heterogeneity of response varies across different marketing interventions, and that the heterogeneity of response to marketing interventions may be partially explained by customer-specific variables related to customer characteristics and the customer\u2019s past interactions with the company.

We use formal models, simulations, and empirical data to suggest that adaptive metric utility balance leads to partworth estimates that are relatively biased\u2014smaller partworths are upwardly biased relative to larger partworths. Such relative biases could lead to erroneous managerial decisions. Metric utility-balanced questions are also more likely to be inefficient and, in one empirical example, contrary to popular wisdom, lead to response errors that are at least as large as nonadaptive orthogonal questions. We demonstrate that this bias is because of endogeneity caused by a \u201cwinner\u2019s curse.\u201d Shrinkage estimates do not mitigate these biases. Combined with adaptive metric utility balance, shrinkage estimates of heterogeneous partworths are biased downward relative to homogeneous partworths. Although biases can affect managerial decisions, our data suggest that, empirically, biases and inefficiencies are of the order of response errors. We examine viable alternatives to metric utility balance that researchers can use without biases or inefficiencies to retain the desired properties of (1) individual-level adaptation and (2) challenging questions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0108","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of conjoint analysis and biases in managerial decision-making without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In turn, we argue that an alignable assortment can efficiently meet the diverse tastes of consumers, thereby increasing brand share, but that a nonalignable assortment increases both the cognitive effort and the potential for regret faced by a consumer, thereby decreasing brand share.

However, it is unclear how promotion affects consumption, especially for product categories that are perceived to be versatile and substitutable. In this paper, we propose a dynamic structural model with endogenous consumption under promotion uncertainty to analyze the promotion effect on consumption. This model recognizes consumers as rational decision makers who form promotion expectations and plan their purchase and consumption decisions in light of promotion schedule. Applying the proposed model to packaged tuna and yogurt, we find that endogenous consumption responds to promotion as a result of forward-looking and stockpiling behavior. This is the first empirical paper that recognizes consumption as an endogenous decision variable and proposes a structural model to offer behavioral explanations on whether, how, and why promotion encourages consumption for product categories with flexible consumption.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1040.0110","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and promotion effects without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Major improvements in the quality of consumer information and the growth of targeted media vehicles allow firms to precisely target advertising to consumer segments within a market. This paper examines advertising strategy when competing firms can target advertising to different groups of consumers within a market. With targeted advertising, we find that firms advertise more to consumers who have a strong preference for their product than to comparison shoppers who can be attracted to the competition. Advertising less to comparison shoppers can be seen as a way for firms to endogenously increase differentiation in the market. In addition, targeting allows the firm to eliminate \u201cwasted\u201d advertising to consumers whose preferences do not match a product\u2019s attributes. As a result, the targeting of advertising increases equilibrium profits. The model demonstrates how advertising strategies are affected by firms being able to target pricing. Target advertising leads to higher profits, regardless of whether or not the firms have the ability to set targeted prices, and the targeting of advertising can be more valuable for firms in a competitive environment than the ability to target pricing.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0117","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of advertising strategy and profitability without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The DSS enables top- and mid-level executives in sales, marketing, strategic planning, and finance to develop accurate forecasts of sales volume, plan prices, and promotional activities over a long time horizon; to track sales response to marketing actions over time; and to simulate forecast scenarios based on possible marketing decisions and other variables. CHAN4CAST is being rolled out for more users and more divisions in the company.

Such network effects profoundly impact marketing strategists' thinking in today's network economy. However, the significant network externalities expected by many people often fail to materialize in the emerging technology market. We analyze this phenomenon in the context of a technology distribution channel. By studying cheap-talk strategies under information asymmetry, we show that incentive-compatible contracts are essential for achieving credible information transmission. In our model, the better-informed technology vendor has an incentive to inflate the retailer's ex ante belief of network externalities when a wholesale price contract is adopted. When properly termed revenue-sharing contracts are implemented, there are information-efficient cheap-talk equilibria where truthful information transmission is mutually beneficial. When the vendor's information is imperfect, even revenue-sharing contracts cannot guarantee credible information transmission if there is significant prior belief disparity between the vendor and the retailer. This study demonstrates how information-inefficient equilibria (e.g., information blockage) arise because of the conflict of interest or the conflict of opinion among channel members. It also explores the role of cheap talk in facilitating channel coordination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0118","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of marketing strategies and information asymmetry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper examines whether, when, and how much brand advertising versus generic advertising should be done. Using differential game theory, optimal advertising decisions are obtained for a dynamic duopoly with symmetric or asymmetric competitors. We show how advertising depends on the cost and effectiveness of each type of advertising for each firm, the allocation of market expansion benefits, and the profit margins determined endogenously from price competition. We find that generic advertising is proportionally more important in the short term and that there are free-riding effects leading to suboptimal industry expenditure on generic advertising that worsen as firms become more symmetric. Due to free-riding by the weaker firm, its instantaneous profit and market share can actually be higher. The effectiveness of generic advertising and the allocation of its benefits, however, have little effect on the long-run market shares, which are determined by brand-advertising effectiveness. Extensions of the model show that market potential saturation leads to a decline in generic advertising over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0119","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on advertising strategies in a competitive market without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is particularly challenging in the movie industry, where the very short lifespan and decaying revenue and exhibition patterns of motion pictures means that the associated time series are short and nonstationary, rendering existing econometric methods unreliable. We propose an alternate method that uses state-space diagrams to determine lead-lag relationships. Straightforward to apply and interpret, it takes advantage of the eye\u2019s ability to see patterns that algebra-based formulations cannot easily recognize. A number of validation tests are provided to illustrate the usefulness and limitations of the method. We study the weekly data for 231 major movies released in 2000\u20132001. While econometric methods do not provide consistent results, the graphical method of visually inferred causality clearly shows a pattern that demand leads distribution for most movies.

Globalization hinders the field, because it has a negative effect on the impact of several major journals (most importantly, the Journal of Marketing and the Journal of Marketing Research). Globalization helps the field, because it has a positive effect on the diversity of our discipline. Important implications of our research are: (1) Journals and sponsoring organizations should strive for more international meetings. (2) Editors, reviewers, and authors should pay more attention to the global relevance of the research they publish, review, and submit. (3) Individual researchers should aim to be part of the global community of marketing scientists through, for instance, international research visits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.1050.0152","","MKS","Marketing","5","['globalization', 'diversity', 'international', 'community']","The article discusses the globalization of authorship and its implications for diversity within the marketing discipline, indicating a moderate focus on social themes.

If the manufacturer designs a contract that is accepted by both retailers, it sets the wholesale price as a compromise between two conflicting roles: reducing intrabrand retail price competition and inducing retailers to stock closer to first-best levels (that is, optimum for the supply chain as a whole). In equilibrium, fill rates are less than first best. If, on the other hand, the manufacturer eliminates retail competition by designing a contract accepted by only one retailer, the assignment of consumers to retailers is inefficient. In either equilibrium, the performance of the supply chain is strictly less than first best. However, the manufacturer achieves first-best retail prices and fill rates if it can subsidize the retailers' leftover inventory. Absent such subsidies, the two-retailer equilibrium arises when the two retailers compete less intensively. In that equilibrium, numerical results indicate that the value of subsidizing unsold inventory is increasing in demand uncertainty, intensity of retail competition, and salvage value of inventory, and is decreasing in manufacturing cost and opportunity cost of shelf space.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0211","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of supply chain management and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The Impact of Contract Manufacturing on Innovation, Capacity, and Profitability","In the electronics industry and others, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are selling their production facilities to contract manufacturers (CMs). The CMs achieve high capacity utilization through pooling (supplying many different OEMs). Meanwhile, the OEMs focus on innovation: research and development, product design, and marketing. We examine how this change in industry structure affects investment in innovation and capacity, and thus profitability. In particular, innovation is noncontractible, so OEMs will invest less in innovation than is ideal for the industry as a whole. Hence, although contract manufacturing improves capacity utilization, it may reduce the profitability of the industry as a whole by weakening the incentives for innovation. Contract manufacturing is not the only means to achieve capacity pooling. Alternatively, the OEMs can pool capacity with one another through supply contracts or a joint venture. This may result in underinvestment or overinvestment in innovation and capacity, but always increases profitability. We find that the sale of production facilities to a CM improves profitability for the industry as a whole if and only if OEMs are subsequently in a strong bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis the CM. If the OEMs are indeed very strong, the gain from pooling capacity via contract manufacturing is maximized in industries with moderate cost of capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0212","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of contract manufacturing, innovation, and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Joining such an alliance leads to reduced costs, including those of possible rivals, because members share the development and operating costs. A company that joins an alliance agrees to share its suppliers with others, which may lead to more intense competition among the increased number of suppliers, and it may further benefit an alliance member at the expense of companies left outside the alliance. Natural questions that could arise, then, are when would a firm prefer to take part in an electronic marketplace joint venture; when would it prefer that other firms, possibly rivals, join the venture; and what are the financial consequences of either joining an alliance or remaining independent? In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the issues, we have developed a model of three retailers whose products may have a certain degree of substitutability. We provide some conditions, in terms of product substitutability and compatibility of retailers, that would lead to the formation of a three-member alliance, or a two-member alliance, or no alliance at all. We also study the effect of alliance structure and compatibility of retailers on the profit of a company.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0213","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of forming alliances in electronic marketplaces to enhance efficiency and reduce costs, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2005","51","1","Ananth V.

The model focuses on two important elements of the \u201ccore\u201d buyer's responsibility: (1) assessing the supplier's capability, and (2) allocating some or all of a fixed level of some buyer-internal resource to help the supplier. Under the contracting scheme we model, the buyer (principal) delegates the majority of product specification and production activity to the supplier (agent), but retains the flexibility to commit a given, observable amount of an internally available, limited resource (e.g., engineering hours) to help the supplier. The supplier, in turn, allocates his resource (e.g., engineering hours) to produce the finished product. As in the motivating scenario, both the supplier's resource allocation and capability are assumed to be hidden from the buyer. Hence, the principal's problem is to determine a menu of (resource-commitment, transfer-price) contracts to minimize her total expected cost. Our analysis demonstrates that if buyer resource and supplier capability are substitutes, then the buyer's second-best involvement in the supplier's production process will be greater than first-best. The opposite is true if they are complements. Further, when the opportunity cost for the buyer's resource is zero, then in the substitutes case the buyer will commit all of its resource, while in the complements case the buyer may withhold some resources to screen the supplier type. We describe two applications of the model\u2014one in inventory management and one in pharmaceutical drug discovery\u2014to illustrate its applicability and versatility. Finally, we use insights from the model to suggest hypotheses for empirical study.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0214","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model related to product specification and production without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such contracts have become more prevalent in the videocassette rental industry relative to the more conventional wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each retailer's purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or outright sales. Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate that revenue sharing coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer (i.e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily allocates the supply chain's profit. We compare revenue sharing to a number of other supply chain contracts (e.g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts, quantity-flexibility contracts, sales-rebate contracts, franchise contracts, and quantity discounts). We find that revenue sharing is equivalent to buybacks in the newsvendor case and equivalent to price discounts in the price-setting newsvendor case. Revenue sharing also coordinates a supply chain with retailers competing in quantities, e.g., Cournot competitors or competing newsvendors with fixed prices. Despite its numerous merits, we identify several limitations of revenue sharing to (at least partially) explain why it is not prevalent in all industries. In particular, we characterize cases in which revenue sharing provides only a small improvement over the administratively cheaper wholesale price contract. Additionally, revenue sharing does not coordinate a supply chain with demand that depends on costly retail effort. We develop a variation on revenue sharing for this setting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0215","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain contracts without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Firms in the supply chain are grouped into homogenous sectors (nodes) that contain identical firms with identical production capabilities that all produce exactly one undifferentiated product (that may itself be a \u201ckit\u201d of components). Each sector may use several inputs to produce its product, and these inputs are supplied by different sectors. The production process within any sector is taken to be pure assembly in fixed proportions. The number of firms in each sector is known. The demand curve for the final product is assumed to be linear, as are production costs in all sectors. Competition is modeled via a \u201ccoordinated successive Cournot\u201d model in which firms choose production quantities for their downstream market so as to maximize profits, given prices for all inputs and all complementary products. Production quantities for sectors supplying the same successor are coordinated through pricing mechanisms, so that complementary products are produced in the right proportions. Under these assumptions, equilibrium prices for any multiechelon assembly network are characterized by a system of linear equations. We derive closed-form expressions for equilibrium quantities and prices in any two-stage system (i.e., a system with multiple input sectors and a single assembly sector). We show that any assembly structure can be converted to an equivalent (larger) structure in which no more than two components are assembled at any node. Finally, large structures can be solved either by direct solution of the characteristic linear equations or through an iterative reduction (compression) to smaller structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0216","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain competition and production processes without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely profit-focused approach."],["2005","51","1","Fangruo ChenFangruo Chenfc26@columbia.eduGraduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027Search for more papers by this author","Salesforce Incentives, Market Information, and Production/Inventory Planning","Salespeople are the eyes and ears of the firms they serve.

Using insights from classical auction theory, we construct an optimization-based auction mechanism (\u201csmart market\u201d) relying on the dynamic resolution of a linear program minimizing the buyer's cost under the suppliers' capacity constraints. Suppliers can modify their offers in response to the optimal allocation corresponding to each set of bids, giving rise to a dynamic competitive bidding process. To assist suppliers, we also develop a bidding-suggestion device based on a myopic best-response (MBR) calculation that solves an associated optimization problem. Assuming linear costs for the suppliers, we study within a game-theoretic framework the sequence of bids arising in this smart market. Under a weak behavioral assumption and some symmetry requirements, an explicit upper bound for the winning bids is established. We then formulate a complete behavioral model and solution methodology based on the MBR rationale and show that the bounds derived earlier continue to hold. We analytically derive some structural and convergence properties of the MBR dynamics in the simplest nontrivial market environment, which suggests further possible design improvements, and investigate bidding dynamics and incentive compatibility issues via numerical simulations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0230","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auction theory and optimization in procurement without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We consider a manufacturer that sells through two distributors. If a customer finds that his distributor is out of stock, then he will sometimes seek to make a purchase from the other distributor; if the latter is also out of stock, the customer will order from both distributors. When his order is filled by one of the distributors, the customer cancels any duplicate orders. Furthermore, the customer cancels all of his outstanding orders after a random period of time. Assuming that the manufacturer is unaware of duplicate orders, we prove that she will overestimate both the demand rate and the cancellation rate. Surprisingly, failure to account for duplicate orders can cause short-term underinvestment in capacity. However, in long-term equilibrium under stable demand conditions the manufacturer overinvests in capacity. Our results suggest that Cisco\u2019s write-off was caused by estimation errors and cannot be blamed entirely on the economic downturn. Finally, we provide some guidance on estimation in the presence of double orders.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0371","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand estimation and capacity investment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that snobs can have an upward-sloping demand curve but only in the presence of consumers who are (weakly) followers. Laboratory tests lend support for this model prediction and for the rational expectations framework.

Second, we identify distinct markets for content providers and end consumers and show that either can be a candidate for a free good.

In this paper, we evaluate customized bundling, a pricing strategy that gives consumers the right to choose up to a quantity M of goods drawn from a larger pool of N different goods for a fixed price. We show that the complex mixed-bundle problem can be reduced to the customized-bundle problem under some commonly used assumptions. We also show that, for a monopoly seller of low marginal cost goods, this strategy outperforms individual selling (M = 1) and pure bundling (M = N) when goods have a positive marginal cost or when customers have heterogeneous preferences over goods. Comparative statics results also show that the optimal bundle size for customized bundling decreases in both heterogeneity of consumer preferences over different goods and marginal costs of production. We further explore how the customized-bundle solution is affected by factors such as the nature of distribution functions in which valuations are drawn, the correlations of values across goods, and the complementarity or substitutability among products. Altogether, our results suggest that customized bundling has a number of advantages\u2014both in theory and practice\u2014over other bundling strategies in many relevant settings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0403","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies for low-marginal-cost goods without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes, thus scoring a 1."],["2005","51","10","J.

This paper introduces a new model called the hub arc location model. Rather than locate discrete hub facilities, this model locates hub arcs, which have reduced unit flow costs. Four special cases of the general hub arc location model are examined in detail. We provide motivation for the new models, and present examples and optimal solutions, using data for U.S. air passenger traffic. Results are used to compare optimal costs, hub locations, and hub arc locations with corresponding hub median optimal solutions. The results reveal interesting spatial patterns and help identify promising cities and regions for hubs.

We present algorithms with a running time that is polynomial in the planning horizon when all cost functions are concave. In addition, we consider different transportation and inventory holding cost structures that yield improved running times: inventory holding cost functions that are linear and transportation cost functions that are either linear, or are concave with a fixed-charge structure. In the latter case, we make the additional common and reasonable assumption that the variable transportation and inventory costs are such that holding inventories at higher levels in the supply chain is more attractive from a variable cost perspective. While the running times of the algorithms are exponential in the number of levels in the supply chain in the general concave cost case, the running times are remarkably insensitive to the number of levels for the other two cost structures.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0378","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Therefore, improvements in the performance of these cutting planes can be of great practical value. In this paper, we present a simple and fast heuristic for improving the coefficients on the continuous variables in the mixed-integer Gomory cuts. This is motivated by the fact that in a mixed-integer Gomory cut, the coefficient of an integer variable lies between 0 and 1, whereas for a continuous variable, there is no upper bound.

We analyze two different estimators based on Malliavin derivatives. The first one, the Malliavin path estimator, extends the path derivative estimator of Broadie and Glasserman (1996) to general diffusion models. The second, the Malliavin weight estimator, proposed by Fourni\u00e9 et al. (1999), is based on an integration by parts argument and generalizes the likelihood ratio derivative estimator. It is shown that for discontinuous payoff functions, only the estimators based on Malliavin derivatives attain the optimal convergence rate for Monte Carlo schemes. Estimators based on the covariation or on finite difference approximations are found to converge at slower rates. Their asymptotic distributions are shown to depend on additional second-order biases even for smooth payoff functions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0398","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of Monte Carlo estimators without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

The accurate measurement of credit risk is often a rare-event simulation problem because default probabilities are low for highly rated obligors and because risk management is particularly concerned with rare but significant losses resulting from a large number of defaults. This makes importance sampling (IS) potentially attractive. But the application of IS is complicated by the mechanisms used to model dependence between obligors, and capturing this dependence is essential to a portfolio view of credit risk. This paper provides an IS procedure for the widely used normal copula model of portfolio credit risk. The procedure has two parts: One applies IS conditional on a set of common factors affecting multiple obligors, the other applies IS to the factors themselves. The relative importance of the two parts of the procedure is determined by the strength of the dependence between obligors. We provide both theoretical and numerical support for the method.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0415","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of credit risk measurement using Monte Carlo simulation and importance sampling, with no mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity, thus reflecting a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2005","51","11","Young K.

In the accounting literature, the relation between conservative accounting and agency costs of type (1) has received considerable attention (cf. Watts 2002). However, little appears to be known about the effects of accounting conservatism on agency costs of type (2) or trade-offs between agency costs of types (1) and (2). The purpose of this study is to examine this void. In a principal-agent setting in which the principal motivates the agent to expend effort using accounting earnings, this study shows that accounting earnings become more useful for reducing agency costs of type (2) when measured conservatively than when measured aggressively. Combined with the result in Kwon et al.

A straightforward way of doing so results in a 3n-dimensional optimization problem with 3n additional constraints. This higher dimensional problem is computationally expensive to solve. We present a method for solving the 3n-dimensional problem by solving a sequence of n-dimensional optimization problems, which accounts for the transaction costs implicitly rather than explicitly. The method is based on deriving the optimality conditions for the higher-dimensional problem solely in terms of lower-dimensional quantities. The new method is compared to the barrier method implemented in Cplex in a series of numerical experiments. With small but positive transaction costs, the barrier method and the new method solve problems in roughly the same amount of execution time. As the size of the transaction cost increases, the new method outperforms the barrier method by a larger and larger factor.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0418","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of portfolio optimization and transaction costs without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

A theoretically optimal contract that mixes penalties based on the amount of pollution ex post with penalties based on the extent of noncompliance ex ante is derived. The effectiveness of USCG inspections and penalties in reducing oil spills is then econometrically studied using microlevel data on a panel of U.S. flag tank vessels. Whether the optimal penalty can potentially improve the effectiveness of compliance inspections in reducing oil spills is examined in the light of the empirical results and recent developments in the economics and public management literature on effective incentive contracting.

In addition, we find that team consensus regarding group potency positively moderates the effects of group potency, so that for teams with higher levels of potency consensus, the positive impact of group potency on customer-perceived service quality is stronger, whereas the negative impact of group potency on service productivity is weaker. Furthermore, we find significant positive effects of management and interteam support and functional diversity as well as a significant negative effect of team tenure on individual team member beliefs of group potency. Finally, social support consensus moderates the effects of management support, interteam support, and team tenure on group potency, so that the effects of these antecedents are weaker for teams with higher levels of social support consensus. Thus, we conclude that team confidence consensus increases the positive impact of group potency on customer perceptions of service quality and decreases the negative impact on profitability.

Operated by access networks and other operators, they provide benefits to content publishers in the forms of bandwidth cost reduction, response time improvement, and handling of flash crowds. Yet, caching has not been fully embraced by publishers, because its use can interfere with site personalization strategies and/or collection of visitor information for business intelligence purposes. While recent work has focused on technological solutions to these issues, this paper provides the first study of the managerial issues related to the design and provisioning of incentive-compatible caching services. Starting with a single class of caching service, we find conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should offer the service for free. This occurs when the access networks\u2019 bandwidth costs are high and a large fraction of content publishers value personalization and business intelligence. Some publishers will still opt out of the service, i.e., cache bust, as observed in practice. We next derive the conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should provision two vertically differentiated service classes, namely, premium and best effort. Interestingly, caching service differentiation is different from traditional vertical differentiation models, in that the premium and best-effort market segments do not abut. Thus, optimal prices for the two service classes can be set independently and cannibalization does not occur. It is possible for the cache operator to continue to offer the best-effort service for free while charging for the premium service. Furthermore, consumers are better off because more content is cached and delivered faster to them. Finally, we find that declining bandwidth costs will put negative pressure on cache operator profits, unless consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the availability of multimedia content provide the necessary increase in traffic volume for the caches.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0420","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical and managerial issues related to caching services and profit maximization, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is generally assumed (Ellsberg 1961) that decision makers (DMs) dislike vagueness, but this assumption has been challenged by empirical results documenting systematic alternative attitudes to vagueness as a function of its source, the domain of the decisions, and the response mode used. We investigate these three factors in a within-subjects design that was embedded in an investment context. DMs evaluated investment options that varied in terms of their sources of vagueness (probabilities and/or outcomes), in both domains (gains or losses), and employed two response modes (pricing or choice). We confirm that individuals\u2019 vagueness attitudes are malleable, contingent on the dimension salience and the reference domain. In particular, we observed three distinct patterns of \u201creversals of attitudes\u201d towards vagueness.

Alternatively, a buyer could choose to conduct a multiattribute auction where bidders can specify both a price and levels of nonprice attributes. While such an auction may provide higher theoretical utility to the buyer, it is not clear that this theoretical improvement will be realized given the increased complexity of the auction. In this research, we present an ascending auction mechanism for a buyer whose utility function is known and dependent on three attributes. Motivated by a supply chain procurement problem setting, we consider quality and lead time for the two attributes in addition to price. The auction mechanism provides the bidders with restricted feedback regarding the buyer\u2019s utility function. We explore, experimentally, the performance of this multiattribute auction mechanism as compared to a price-only auction mechanism.

The systematic risk of stochastic demand has typically a negligible effect on the optimal values of R and Q, although an improvement may be achieved by a simple adjustment of R. The systematic risk of the purchase price, c, has a significant effect on R and Q. The capital holding cost should be estimated as r \u00b7 c, where r is the sum of the risk-free interest rate, the expected price decrease, and the risk premium associated with the systematic risk of c.

Our analytical modelling framework incorporates optimal pricing and stocking decisions for both echelons in the presence of stochastic demand and random delivery times. We focus on understanding how these decisions for the chain are affected by its management paradigm (centralized or decentralized), and its business characteristics\u2014price sensitivity, demand uncertainty, and delivery time variability. A novel combination of transformations enables us to analyze the framework and determine the unique optimal choices for centralized and wholesale price-based decentralized supply chains. More detailed investigation reveals that, in general, the business characteristics influence both the behavior and the optimal values of the decision variables, while the management paradigm primarily governs the optimal values. We illustrate the significance of these results in terms of how managers should tailor their decisions to align with their business requirements. Subsequently, comparison of the optimal profits between the channel partners and the management paradigms provides implications for decentralization strategy. A decentralized chain is most inefficient for moderately price-sensitive customers and uncertain environments, but is relatively more effective when dealing with mature products. We propose a contracting scheme that can improve the decentralized chain profit in reliable delivery time settings. The salient modelling insight of this paper is that ignoring the randomness of delivery time trivializes the interaction between pricing and stocking decisions. On the other hand, from a managerial viewpoint, we establish that optimal pricing policies provide the means to increase revenue and also act as strategic tools for tackling uncertainty.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0452","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and decision-making under uncertainty without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We analyze data on the terms of contracting to determine whether transaction and supplier characteristics that generate opportunistic hazards are related to the formal management control structure. We also examine whether misalignment between transaction and supplier characteristics and the control structure is associated with ex post performance problems. Characteristics associated with hazards are found to be positively related to contract extensiveness. Factor analysis of the use of 24 contract terms reveals four groups of contract terms that are commonly used in combination. We interpret these factors as \u201cdimensions of management control\u201d and label them: assignment of rights, product and price, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Characteristics associated with hazards are positively related to the use of all four dimensions of management control, with different hazards associated with different controls. We then examine the relation between transaction characteristics and ex post transaction problems, demonstrating that even in the presence of mutually agreeable contracts, hazards remain. We conclude that costs of contracting are associated with increased use of contract terms on assignment of rights, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Finally, we present evidence that management control structures that are better aligned with transaction hazards mitigate subsequent performance problems, though at a nontrivial cost of contracting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0456","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on transaction characteristics and management control structures without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The model explains 66.7% of the within-firm variation and 97.2% of the total variation (across and within firms) in inventory turnover. It yields an alternative metric of inventory productivity, adjusted inventory turnover, which empirically adjusts inventory turnover for changes in gross margin, capital intensity, and sales surprise, and can be applied in performance analysis and managerial decision making.

In both schemes, a customer obtains priority over all customers, waiting in the queue or arriving while he is waiting, who make lower bids.

Empirical studies of call centers indicate that the service-time and abandon-time distributions often are not nearly exponential, so that it is important to go beyond the Markovian M/M/s/r+M special case, but the general service-time and abandon-time distributions make the realistic model very difficult to analyze directly. The proposed algorithm is based on an approximation by an appropriate Markovian M/M/s/r+M(n) queueing model, where M(n) denotes state-dependent abandonment rates. After making an additional approximation, steady-state waiting-time distributions are characterized via their Laplace transforms. Then the approximate distributions are computed by numerically inverting the transforms. Simulation experiments show that the approximation is quite accurate. The overall algorithm can be applied to determine desired staffing levels, e.g., the minimum number of servers needed to guarantee that, first, the abandonment rate is below any specified target value and, second, that the conditional probability that an arriving customer will be served within a specified deadline, given that the customer eventually will be served, is at least a specified target value.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0302","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for call center performance measures without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The supplier's delivery performance is measured by its ability to meet delivery dates requested by the customers.

However, little is known about how access to a decision aid or the availability of competitors' market outcomes impact a firm's competitive decisions (e.g., prices) or market outcomes resulting from those decisions (e.g., profits), or how managers make these decisions across such informational conditions. Hence, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate whether access to a decision aid and historical information of competitors' outcomes yields more- or less-competitive decisions and outcomes. Second, we determine which learning constructs, such as choice reinforcement and beliefs about projected profits, best explain competitive actions across various information conditions. We find that relative to the availability of competitive information, access to a decision aid has a larger effect on lowering prices and profits. We also find that in two-firm markets, price competition is even more intense than in five-firm markets. Similarly, the availability of market share information leads to more aggressive pricing even when profits are held constant.

In a make-to-order environment, this flexibility can also be used to hedge against variability in customer orders in the short term. For that purpose, production levels must be adjusted each period to match current demands, to give priority to the higher margin product, or to satisfy the closest customer. However, this will result in swings in production, inducing larger order variability at upstream suppliers and significantly higher component inventory levels at the manufacturer. Through a stylized two-plant, two-product capacitated manufacturing setting, we show that the performance of the system depends heavily on the allocation mechanism used to assign products to the available capacity. Although managers would be inclined to give priority to higher-margin products or to satisfy customers from their closest production site, these practices lead to greater swings in production, result in higher operational costs, and may reduce profits.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0322","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and capacity management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Conventionally, reduced consumer search costs may be expected to engender stronger price competition between firms, resulting in lower prices and improved consumer welfare. This notion was formalized in Stahl (1989, \u201cOligopolistic pricing with sequential consumer search,\u201d American Economic Review, Vol. 79, No. 4, pp. 700\u2013712) in a model of static firm competition. In this paper, we show that these standard welfare conclusions may be neutralized or reversed in a dynamic environment. We focus on self-enforcing collusion by firms and characterize the conditions under which collusive equilibria exist. We show that less costly consumer search can facilitate firms' abilities to collude, resulting in higher prices and reduced consumer welfare, even with imperfect or no monitoring by sellers of each other's prices. If the same technology that eases consumer search also allows firms to monitor each other's prices more easily, then firms can more easily detect cheating on a collusive price arrangement, allowing an even greater scope for collusion. This raises antitrust concerns with respect to the electronic marketplace and suggests that at least some of the anticipated competitive gains from electronic market systems may be difficult to realize.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0327","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market dynamics and collusion without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, in recent controlled experiments with actual Dutch and sealed-bid Internet auctions of collectibles, the Dutch auctions produced significantly more revenue. We believe that this happened, in part, because the Internet Dutch auctions are a slow process in which bidders incur incremental transaction costs if they delay bidding. This paper presents models of slow Dutch auctions that include these costs and explain this belief. We first present a decision-theoretic model of a slow Dutch auction. While simple, the decision-theoretic model is fairly general and provides the basic intuition underlying our revenue results. We then develop a game-theoretic model of a slow Dutch auction. We derive two symmetric, payoff-equivalent equilibria of the game in the absence of a cost of return and then consider the more general case of costly return. When the cost of return is in an appropriate range, the seller's expected revenue is an increasing function of that cost.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0328","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of auction models and revenue generation without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show that the naive bidder earns higher equilibrium profits than the rational bidder when the signal distribution is symmetric and unimodal. We then consider a sequence of such auctions with randomly selected participants from a population of naive and rational bidders, with the proportion of bidder types in the population evolving in response to their relative payoffs in the auctions. We show that the evolutionary equilibrium contains a strictly positive proportion of naive bidders. Finally, we consider more general examples in which a naive bidder matched against a rational bidder does (i) worse than his rational opponent, but (ii) better than a rational bidder matched against another rational bidder. Again, the evolutionary equilibrium contains a strictly positive proportion of naive bidders. The results suggest that overconfident recent entrants in Internet and other low transaction-cost auctions of items that appeal to a mass audience may earn higher payoffs than their experienced competitors and, thus, will not eventually be driven from the market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0330","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding strategies in auctions without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The IMA Volumes in Mathematics and Its Applications, Vol. 127, Springer-Verlag, New York, 15\u201326). This formulation has a variable for every possible combination of winning bids for each bidder. Our algorithm exploits the structure of the XOR-of-OR bidding language used by the FCC. We also present a new methodology to produce realistic test problems based on the round-by-round results of FCC Auction #4. We generate 2,639 test problems, which involve 99 items and are substantially larger than most of the previously used benchmark problems. Because there are no real-life test problems for combinatorial spectrum auctions with the XOR-of-OR language, we used these test problems to observe the computational behavior of our algorithm. Our algorithm can solve all but one test problem within 10 minutes, appears to be very robust, and for difficult instances compares favorably to the natural formulation solved using a commercial optimization package with default settings. Although spectrum auctions are used as the guiding example to describe the merits of branch and price for combinatorial auctions, our approach applies to auctions of multiple goods in other scenarios similarly.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0332","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical algorithm for spectrum auctions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The determination of packages for bidding is a nontrivial task, and existing efficient formats require that bidders know the set of packages and/or their valuations. In this paper, we extend an efficient ascending combinatorial auction mechanism to use approximate single-item pricing. The single-item prices in each round are derived from a linear program that is constructed to reflect the current allocation of packages. Introduction of approximate single-item prices allows for endogenous bid determination where bidders can discover packages that were not included in the original bid set. Due to nonconvexities, single-item prices may not exist that are exact marginal values. We show that the use of approximate single-item prices with endogenous bidding always produces allocations that are at least as efficient as those from bidding with a fixed set of packages based on package pricing. A network resource allocation example is given that illustrates the benefits of our endogenous bidding mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0335","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of combinatorial auctions and bidder mechanisms without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consumers whose offers have been rejected can invest in additional haggling effort and increment their offers. This pricing model allows the name-your-own-price retailer to engage in price discrimination: As haggling is costly for the potential buyer, customers with a high willingness to haggle will achieve lower transaction prices. However, because haggling is costly, it reduces overall welfare and diminishes the benefits of price discrimination. Our study is motivated by several name-your-own-price retailers that have recently emerged on the Internet. Based on detailed transaction data of a large German name-your-own-price retailer, we present a model of consumer haggling. We then show how this model can be used to improve the decision making of the retailer, who needs to choose a threshold price above which all offers are accepted.

The interaction between firms operating across these differentiated channels involves interesting competitive dynamics that cannot be captured by isolated models of electronic markets. This paper develops a stylized spatial differentiation model to examine the impact of differences in channel flexibility, network externalities, and switching costs on competition between online, traditional, and hybrid firms. A basic model highlighting the moderating influence of the hybrid firm on both channels is extended to account for differential network externalities and switching costs across the two channels. Our analysis indicates that while network effects as well as switching costs lead to the tipping of markets, such tipping occurs primarily due to the moderating effects of the competing channel. More importantly, with network effects an increased market share does not translate into higher profits. Contradictory to conventional wisdom, our results indicate that in a static market, consumers rather than firms, benefit from increasing network externalities, with competitive effects outweighing the surplus-extraction abilities of firms. Our results also highlight the importance of alternative revenue streams and provide insights for firms grappling with issues of channel choice as well as integration and divestiture.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0338","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['network externalities', 'competitive dynamics', 'consumer benefits']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of competition and market dynamics without addressing social justice or ethical considerations.

Contract pricing involves both a reservation fee per unit of capacity and an execution fee per unit of output if capacity is called. The key question addressed is the structure of the optimal portfolios of contracting and spot market transactions for the buyer and these sellers, and the pricing thereof in market equilibrium. Existence and structure of market equilibria are characterized for the associated competitive game between sellers with heterogeneous technologies, under the assumption that they know the buyer's demand function. This allows an explicit characterization of the price of capacity options and the value of managerial flexibility, as well as providing conditions under which B2B exchanges are efficient and sustainable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0341","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and B2B transactions without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In practice, the activity schedule is typically determined by the contractor rather than the client. This paper addresses this drawback by considering a model in which the client selects the payment activities and the contractor selects the activity schedule, each to maximize his own net present value (NPV). In addition, the contractor has the option to reject the project if it does not provide a minimum NPV. The new model is shown to be NP-hard in the strong sense and a branch-and-bound procedure is provided for its solution. Results are obtained for the new model that contradict those of the older models. The benefits to the client are no longer increasing with retention and no longer decreasing with the number of payments. Furthermore, it is no longer ideal for the client to focus payments at the beginning and end of the project. Empirical evidence based on a randomly generated data set suggests that the market for the contractor\u2019s services, the timing of benefits received by the client, and the project duration drive these new results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0319","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of payment scheduling and contractor-client dynamics without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2005","51","4","Markus ChristenMarkus Christenmarkus.christen@insead.eduINSEAD, Boulevard de Constance, 77305 Fontainebleau-Cedex, FranceSearch for more papers by this author","Research Note\u2014Cost Uncertainty Is Bliss: The Effect of Competition on the Acquisition of Cost Information for Pricing New Products","We examine the optimal acquisition of information about a common uncertain cost factor by two competing firms seeking to price a new product. We show that existing findings regarding the acquisition of demand information or the acquisition of either cost or demand information related to quantity decisions do not extend to this case. For cost information with price competition, the information acquisition strategies are strategic substitutes, even though the price decisions that are based on the information are strategic complements. Competition decreases the expected value of cost information. Moreover, when competition is intense and the cost of information low, identical firms do not acquire the same amount of cost information\u2014even when information is free. Cost uncertainty acts like a \u201cfog\u201d that lessens the destructive effect of price competition when products are close substitutes, and thus increases expected profits. Buyers, on the other hand, are better off when competing firms are informed about cost. Even though the expected value of cost information strictly decreases with competition, the optimal price for industry-specific cost information set by an information vendor increases with competition when the firms\u2019 products are sufficiently substitutable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0320","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of cost information acquisition and competition without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper we analyze a decentralized dealer network in which each independent dealer is given the flexibility to share his inventory. We model inventory sharing as a multiple demand classes problem in which each dealer faces his own customer demand with high priority, and inventory-sharing requests from other dealers with low priority. Assuming that each dealer uses a base-stock and threshold-rationing policy for his inventory-stocking and inventory-sharing decisions, we explicitly model the interactions between the dealers through inventory sharing and obtain a closed-form cost function for each dealer based on the steady-state distribution of the inventory levels at the two dealers. We then provide a detailed supermodularity analysis of the inventory-sharing and inventory-rationing game in which each dealer has a two-dimensional strategy set (stocking level and rationing level). We show that the full-sharing game (in which dealers precommit to sharing all of their on-hand inventory) and the fixed-sharing-level game (in which dealers precommit to sharing a portion of their on-hand inventory) are supermodular, and thus a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist. For the rationing game (in which dealers precommit to their stocking levels), we show that there exists a dominant strategy equilibrium on the dealers\u2019 sharing (rationing) levels. Finally, a comprehensive computational study is conducted to highlight the impact of the manufacturer\u2019s incentives, subsidies, and/or transshipment fees on the dealers\u2019 sharing behavior.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0321","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory sharing and rationing in dealer networks without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this model, a set of jobs (i.e., customer orders) are first processed in a processing facility (e.g., manufacturing plant or service center) and then delivered to the customers directly without intermediate inventory. The problem is to find a joint schedule of production and distribution such that an objective function that takes into account both customer service level and total distribution cost is optimized. Customer service level is measured by a function of the times when the jobs are delivered to the customers. The distribution cost of a delivery shipment consists of a fixed charge and a variable cost proportional to the total distance of the route taken by the shipment. We study two classes of problems under this integrated scheduling model. In the first class of problems, customer service is measured by the average time when the jobs are delivered to the customers; in the second class, customer service is measured by the maximum time when the jobs are delivered to the customers. Two machine configurations in the processing facility\u2014single machine and parallel machine\u2014are considered. For each of the problems studied, we provide an efficient exact algorithm, or a proof of intractability accompanied by a heuristic algorithm with worst-case and asymptotic performance analysis. Computational experiments demonstrate that the heuristics developed are capable of generating near-optimal solutions. We also investigate the possible benefit of using the proposed integrated model relative to a sequential model where production and distribution operations are scheduled sequentially and separately. Computational tests show that in many cases a significant benefit can be achieved by integration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0325","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and distribution scheduling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We investigate it in a laboratory setting using a novel multistage trust game where social gains are achieved if players trust each other in each stage. In each stage, also, players have an opportunity to appropriate these gains or be trustworthy by sharing them. Players are strangers because they do not know the identity of others and they will not play them again. Thus, there is no prospect of future interaction to induce trusting behavior, and we study the trust-building process where there is little scope for social relations and networks. Standard game theory, which assumes all players are opportunistic and untrustworthy and thus should have zero trust for others, is used to construct a null hypothesis. We test whether people are trusting or trustworthy and examine how inferring the intentions of those who trust affects trustworthiness. We also investigate the effect of stake on trust, and study the evolution of trust. Results show subjects exhibit some degree of trusting behavior, although a majority of them are not trustworthy and claim the entire social gain. Players are more reluctant to trust in later stages than in earlier ones and are more trustworthy if they are certain of the trustee\u2019s intention. Surprisingly, subjects are more trusting and trustworthy when the stake size increases. Finally, we find the subpopulation that invests in initiating the trust-building process modifies its trusting behavior based on the relative fitness of trust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0350","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['trust', 'social gains', 'trustworthy']","The article explores the concept of trust in social interactions, which touches on social dynamics but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We use an empirical approach, based on the estimation methods used for standard random coefficients logit models, to account for the presence of such unobserved attributes. Using household scanner panel data, we find evidence that ignoring such time-varying latent (to the researcher) characteristics can lead to two types of problems. First, consistent with previous literature, we find that these unobserved characteristics may lead to biased estimates of the mean price response parameters. This argument is based on a form of price endogeneity. If marketing managers set prices based on consumer willingness to pay, then the observed prices will likely be correlated with the latent (to the researcher) brand characteristics. We resolve this problem by using an instrumental variables procedure. Our findings suggest that simply ignoring these attributes may also lead to larger estimates of the variance in the heterogeneity distribution of preferences and price sensitivities across households. This could overstate the benefits from marketing activities such as household-level targeting. We resolve the problem by using weekly brand intercepts, embedded in a random coefficients brand choice model, to control for weekly brand-specific characteristics, while accounting for household heterogeneity. Overall, our results extend the finding on the endogeneity bias from the mean of the heterogeneity distribution (i.e., the price effect) to include the variance of that distribution.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0323","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of brand characteristics and consumer choice without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I measure knowledge flows using patent citation data, and employ a novel regression framework based on choice-based sampling to estimate the probability of knowledge flow between inventors of any two patents. As expected, intraregional and intrafirm knowledge flows are found to be stronger than those across regional or firm boundaries. I explore whether these patterns can be explained by direct and indirect network ties among inventors, as inferred from past collaborations among them. The existence of a tie is found to be associated with a greater probability of knowledge flow, with the probability decreasing as the path length (geodesic) increases.

In fact, being in the same region or firm is found to have little additional effect on the probability of knowledge flow among inventors who already have close network ties.

In the year leading up to the announcement, the control-adjusted mean percent changes in operating income, return on sales, and return on assets for the sample firms are \u2212107%, \u2212114%, and \u221292%, respectively. During this same period, the control-adjusted changes in the level of return on sales and return on assets are \u221213.78% and \u22122.32%, respectively. Relative to controls, firms that experience glitches report on average 6.92% lower sales growth, 10.66% higher growth in cost, and 13.88% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches. During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve.

The recently proposed conditional autoregressive value at risk (CAViaR) models require no such assumption, and allow quantiles to be modeled directly in an autoregressive framework. Although useful for risk management, CAViaR models do not provide volatility forecasts. Such forecasts are needed for several other important applications, such as option pricing and portfolio management. It has been found that, for a variety of probability distributions, there is a surprising constancy of the ratio of the standard deviation to the interval between symmetric quantiles in the tails of the distribution, such as the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles. This result has been used in decision and risk analysis to provide an approximation of the standard deviation in terms of quantile estimates provided by experts. Drawing on the same result, we construct financial volatility forecasts as simple functions of the interval between CAViaR forecasts of symmetric quantiles. Forecast comparison, using five stock indices and 20 individual stocks, shows that the method is able to outperform generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and moving average methods.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0355","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial volatility forecasting without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In practice, the seat allocation decisions of one airline affect the passenger demands for seats on other airlines. In this paper, we examine the seat inventory control problem under both horizontal competition (two airlines compete for passengers on the same flight leg) and vertical competition (different airlines fly different legs on a multileg itinerary). Such vertical competition can be the outcome of a code-sharing agreement between airlines, because each airline sells seats on the partner airlines\u2019 flights but the airlines are unwilling, or unable, to coordinate yield management decisions. We provide a general sufficient condition under which a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in these revenue management games, and we also compare the total number of seats available in each fare class with, and without, competition. Analytical results as well as numerical examples demonstrate that more seats are protected for higher-fare passengers under horizontal competition than when a single airline acts as a monopoly. Under vertical competition the booking limit may be higher or lower, however, than the monopoly level, depending on the demand for connecting flights in each fare class. Finally, we discuss revenue-sharing contracts that coordinate the actions of both airlines.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0356","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of revenue management in the airline industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Think Again","Software vulnerability disclosure has become a critical area of concern for policymakers. Traditionally, a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) acts as an infomediary between benign identifiers (who voluntarily report vulnerability information) and software users. After verifying a reported vulnerability, CERT sends out a public advisory so that users can safeguard their systems against potential exploits. Lately, firms such as iDefense have been implementing a new market-based approach for vulnerability information. The market-based infomediary provides monetary rewards to identifiers for each vulnerability reported. The infomediary then shares this information with its client base. Using this information, clients protect themselves against potential attacks that exploit those specific vulnerabilities. The key question addressed in our paper is whether movement toward such a market-based mechanism for vulnerability disclosure leads to a better social outcome. Our analysis demonstrates that an active unregulated market-based mechanism for vulnerabilities almost always underperforms a passive CERT-type mechanism. This counterintuitive result is attributed to the market-based infomediary\u2019s incentive to leak the vulnerability information inappropriately. If a profit-maximizing firm is not allowed to (or chooses not to) leak vulnerability information, we find that social welfare improves. Even a regulated market-based mechanism performs better than a CERT-type one, but only under certain conditions. Finally, we extend our analysis and show that a proposed mechanism\u2014federally funded social planner\u2014always performs better than a market-based mechanism.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0357","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['social outcome', 'vulnerability disclosure', 'social welfare']","The article discusses the social implications of software vulnerability disclosure mechanisms, highlighting the importance of social welfare over profit-maximization.

We propose a single-period inventory modelling framework with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on supply chain flexibility. We consider two complementary forms of flexibility: quantity flexibility in production and timing flexibility in scheduling. In this framework, we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm for alternate demand types. We model functional products through the standard assumption of independent demand over the period, fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model, and innovative products with evolving demand through a Martingale process. The three demand processes exhibit very different behavior with respect to the value of the alternate forms of flexibility. We observe that quantity flexibility is of moderate value for functional goods and of high value for fashion-driven products for all lead times. Quantity flexibility is of low value for goods with evolving demand with long lead times but of high value for short lead times. Alternately, we observe timing flexibility is of highest value for functional goods, especially for cases of high holding cost, and is of lesser value for fashion-driven goods. It is of least value for goods with evolving demand. Both quantity and timing flexibility capabilities are required to significantly reduce the relevant supply chain costs for evolving-demand innovative goods when the lead times are long.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0359","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain flexibility and inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Advances in technology can make it easier for people to spend more time on special interests and to screen out unwanted contact. Geographic boundaries can thus be supplanted by boundaries on other dimensions. This paper formally defines a precise set of measures of information integration and develops a model of individual knowledge profiles and community affiliation.

This research has also shown that historical trajectories followed by organizational populations only partly conform to the predictions of the original model. Inconsistencies with the model\u2019s predictions prompt a series of questions: Why do organizational populations suddenly collapse after reaching a peak? Why do organizational populations oscillate after collapsing? What causes extinction of organizational forms? To address these questions, scholars have proposed a variety of modifications to the original model of density dependence. All have merit, but none is completely satisfying. The main objective of this study is to narrow the gap between theories, models, and observed historical trajectories by identifying a unitary analytical framework that can account for the variety of empirical trajectories typically followed by mature organizational populations. The model that we present is based on the hypothesis of system-dependent selection, according to which patterns of resource availability are produced by processes that are partly endogenous to organizational populations. The main analytical insight of the study is that under conditions of dynamic resource constraints introduced by system-dependent selection, the presence of population-level inertia leads to a rich variety of historical trajectories during population maturity. We show that this result holds in the absence of any particular assumption about the microstructure of organizational populations. Possible trajectories include sustained oscillations, resurgence, and extinction.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0364","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical research regarding organizational populations and resource constraints without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Some firms, however, learn from their experience at a dramatic rate, while other firms exhibit very little learning at all. Three factors have been identified that affect the rate at which firms learn: (a) the proficiency of individual workers, (b) the ability of firm members to leverage knowledge accumulated by others, and (c) the capacity for coordinated activity inside the organization. Each factor varies with a particular kind of experience. An increase in cumulative individual experience increases individual proficiency. An increase in cumulative organizational experience provides individuals with the opportunity to benefit from knowledge accumulated by others. An increase in cumulative experience working together promotes more effective coordination and teamwork. To gain insight into factors responsible for the learning curve, we examine the contribution of each kind of experience to performance, while controlling for the impact of the other two. The study context is a teaching hospital. The task is a total joint replacement procedure, and the performance metric is procedure completion time.

Furthermore, the proliferation of powerful customer relationship management (CRM) systems is providing the data and the communications channels necessary to extend this type of pricing strategy into true dynamic marketing policies that adjust pricing as customer relationships evolve. In this paper, we describe a dynamic programming\u2013based approach to creating optimal relationship pricing policies. The methodology has two main components. The first component is a latent class logit model that is used to model customer buying behavior. The second component is a dynamic optimization procedure that computes profit-maximizing price paths. The methodology is illustrated using subscriber data provided by a large metropolitan newspaper. The empirical results provide support for the common managerial practice of offering discounts to new customers. However, in contrast to current practice, the results suggest the use of a series of decreasing discounts based on the length of customer tenure rather than a single steep discount for first-time purchasers. The dynamic programming (DP) methodology also represents an important approach to calculating customer value (CV). Specifically, the DP framework allows the calculation of CV to be an explicit function of marketing policies and customer status. As such, this method for calculating CV accounts for the value of managerial flexibility and improves upon existing methods that do not model revenue and attrition rates as functions of marketing variables.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0373","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing strategies and customer relationship management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These models view intangibles as composed of a set of fundamental business activities and use multiple financial and nonfinancial metrics causally interlinked to profits to represent this view. Using a unique and proprietary cross-sectional data set of the retail banking industry, we provide some of the first tests on the empirical validity of such measurement models. We characterize the core deposit intangible, an important retail banking intangible representing a bank\u2019s relationships with its customers, using financial and nonfinancial metrics on price, service, customer usage, and customer satisfaction. We find that the metrics do not individually predict future earnings, but gain individual significance in a collective setting, increasing the predictive power substantially. We argue that this result occurs because the activities underlying the measures are causally interlinked to profits and explicitly illustrate these linkages with a structural path model. Our measurement model also predicts significant interactive effects in the way our measures are informative about future profits, and we document such effects, not just among the individual measures, but also across the measures and environmental factors such as the bank\u2019s strategy.

This makes the financial report less useful to the follower and expected financial success more likely for the leader. Alternatively, when the financial report does not provide useful information to the follower (e.g., the financial report aggregates many activities in addition to the activity the follower is interested in), it may be the follower rather than the leader who makes the choice less likely to be operationally successful.

The ability to detect and respond to these regime shifts is critical for economic success. We conduct three experiments to test how effective individuals are at detecting such regime shifts. Specifically, we investigate when individuals are most likely to underreact to change and when they are most likely to overreact to it. We develop a system-neglect hypothesis: Individuals react primarily to the signals they observe and secondarily to the environmental system that produced the signal. The experiments, two involving probability estimation and one involving prediction, reveal a behavioral pattern consistent with our system-neglect hypothesis: Underreaction is most common in unstable environments with precise signals, and overreaction is most common in stable environments with noisy signals. We test this pattern formally in a statistical comparison of the Bayesian model with a parametric specification of the system-neglect model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0386","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on decision-making in dynamic environments and behavioral patterns related to market reactions, without any mention of socially progressive themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Such information can help firms increase their profits through cross-selling opportunities. However, revealing personal preferences and contact information can raise the risks for customers when dealing with a firm. Consequently, some customers trade off the benefit and risks of revealing information. As the opportunity to obtain a higher level of information increases, customers incur a higher level of risk when dealing with a firm. This increases the firm\u2019s incentive to commit on a cross-selling level. By such a commitment, a firm can obtain customer intimacy and benefit from detailed customer information. As a result, profits increase while prices decrease. Thus, legal regulations that explicitly require firms to spell out the extent of cross-selling may actually improve the profits of the firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0390","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['customer information', 'risks', 'legal regulations']","The article primarily focuses on profit maximization through customer information and cross-selling strategies, with only a brief mention of risks to customers.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms can achieve internal benefits such as quality or productivity improvements or that certification can help firms maintain or increase their market share, or both. Others argue that the standard is too generic to cause performance improvement but can be seen as a signal of good management. In this paper, we track financial performance from 1987 to 1997 of all publicly traded ISO 9000 certified manufacturing firms in the United States with SIC codes 2000\u20133999, and test whether ISO 9000 certification leads to productivity improvements, market benefits, and improved financial performance. We employ event-study methods, matching each certified firm to a control group of one or more noncertified firms in the same industry with similar precertification size and/or return on assets. We find that firms\u2019 decision to seek their first ISO 9000 certification was indeed followed by significant abnormal improvements in financial performance, though the exact timing and magnitude of this effect depend on the specification of the control group. Three years after certification, the certified firms do display strongly significant abnormal performance under all control-group specifications. The degree to which the precise results vary across control-group specifications indicates that event studies should always include extensive sensitivity analysis, for instance matching by size and performance separately and jointly, using both single firms and portfolios as controls.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1040.0358","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on the financial performance and productivity improvements associated with ISO 9000 certification, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The observation of an increasing price volatility with decreasing inventory is often mentioned in the literature, but has so far been documented using a proxy for inventory (see Fama and French 1987, 1988; Litzenberger and Rabinowitz 1995). Instead, we reconstruct a yearly, quarterly, and monthly database of worldwide soybean inventories using aggregate data from the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. We show that under all time scales, price volatility is an increasing linear function of inverse inventory, which we term \u201cscarcity.\u201d Second, we show how the addition of the factor scarcity in a state-variable approach to the dynamics of the term structure of soybean forward prices improves the quality of the fit.

We embed PP in a model of vertical product differentiation and show how it affects firms\u2019 choices over quality. We show that firms\u2019 optimal pricing strategies with PP may be nonmonotonic in consumer valuations. When the PP firm has high quality, both firms raise their qualities relative to the uniform pricing case. Conversely, when the PP firm has low quality, both firms lower their qualities. Although many firms are trying to implement such pricing policies, we find that a higher-quality firm can actually be worse off with PP. While it is optimal for the firm adopting PP to increase product differentiation, the non-PP firm seeks to reduce differentiation by moving in closer in the quality space. While PP results in a wider market coverage, it also leads to aggravated price competition between firms. Because this entails a change in equilibrium qualities, the nature of the cost function determines whether firms gain or lose by implementing such PP policies. Despite the threat of first-degree price discrimination, we find that PP with competing firms can lead to an overall increase in consumer welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0383","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['consumer welfare', 'pricing', 'quality']","The article primarily focuses on analytical frameworks for pricing strategies and their implications for market competition, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

This leads to the formulation of the problem as a two-stage recourse program whose optimal policy structure features two forms of flexibility denoted as operational hedging: (1) production hedging, where the firm deliberately produces less than the total demand; and (2) allocation hedging, where due to unfavorable exchange rates, some markets are not served despite having unused production. Our characterization of the optimal policy structure leads to an economic valuation of production and allocation hedging. We show that the prevalence of production hedging is moderated by the degree of correlation between exchange rates. A comprehensive examination under the following four generalized settings provides the depth, scope, and relevancy that our proposed operational hedges play to facilitate aggregate planning: (1) multiple periods, (2) demand uncertainty, (3) price setting or monopolistic pricing, and (4) price setting under demand uncertainty. We show that production and allocation hedging are robust for these generalizations and should be integrated into the overall aggregate planning strategy of a global manufacturing firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0384","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production planning and exchange-rate uncertainty without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on a different property of rebates: their ability to price discriminate within a consumer among her postpurchase states. Unlike price discrimination between consumers, this property is unique to rebates because, by design, they are redeemed after the purchase. (Coupons, by contrast, are redeemed with the purchase.) The consumer redeems the rebate only in postpurchase states in which her marginal utility of income is high. This selective redemption behavior provides an opportunity for the seller to \u201cutility arbitrage,\u201d directing discounts to when they matter most, resulting in an increase in the consumer\u2019s up-front willingness to pay. In turn, this enables an increase in the regular price. Of course, rebates can still price discriminate among consumers. Indeed, their ability to deliver state-dependent discounts may enhance their overall price discrimination ability, as we show in an example comparing them to coupons.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0391","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of price discrimination and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion."],["2005","51","7","Samir ElhedhliSamir Elhedhlielhedhli@engmail.uwaterloo.caDepartment of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, 200 University West, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author, Jean-Louis GoffinJean-Louis Goffinjean-louis.goffin@mcgill.caFaculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1G5, CanadaSearch for more papers by this author","Efficient Production-Distribution System Design","The production-distribution system design is an integral part of the general supply chain design.

It has the added benefit of realizing imputed commodity prices for the various services, a feature lacking in the discriminatory GVA approach. For service providers that are concerned about the incentive compatibility but want imputed service prices, we suggest a maximal MVA (mMVA) uniform-pricing scheme that trades off revenue maximization for allocative efficiency.

There might be multiple options to supply a raw material, to manufacture or assemble the product, and to transport the product to the customer. Each of these options is differentiated by its lead time and direct cost added. Given these various choices along the supply chain, the configuration problem is to select the options that minimize the total supply chain cost. We develop a dynamic program with two state variables to solve the supply chain configuration problem for supply chains that are modeled as spanning trees. We illustrate the problem and its solution with an industrial example. We use the example to show the benefit from optimization relative to heuristics and to form hypotheses concerning the structure of optimal supply chain configurations.

According to one school of thought, marketers should make products hard to get in order to create really hot products. In this paper, using a game-theoretic model, we investigate if such scarcity strategies can indeed be optimal. While a scarcity strategy may appear to be a viable approach for making a firm\u2019s product successful, further analysis raises some puzzling issues. In particular, it is not clear why a firm would not increase its price to get demand and supply in sync and increase its profit in the process. We therefore offer a signaling explanation for the optimality of such strategies and show that a high-quality seller may optimally choose to make the product scarce in order to credibly signal the quality of its product to uninformed customers. Our analysis indicates that a high-quality seller optimally employs scarcity as a signaling device in product markets that are characterized, ceteris paribus, by a small difference in marginal cost between high- and low-quality products, a low reservation price for a low-quality product, a greater heterogeneity in reservation prices for a high-quality product, and a moderate number of informed consumers. Our results provide a rationale for the fact that scarcity strategies are usually observed for discretionary or specialty products, but not for commodity products, staple products, or new-to-the-world products.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0381","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on marketing strategies and profitability without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We also consider the related question of the impact of increased project uncertainty on the value of management flexibility, defined as the difference in value when the project is managed \u201cactively\u201d versus when it is under \u201cpassive\u201d management. These questions have already been formulated in an insightful paper in the literature, where different sources of variability and uncertainty in R&D projects are identified and abandonment and improvement at interim stages are considered as options that provide management flexibility. We follow the same formulation. We derive a set of negative results that are contrary to the results of the above-mentioned paper and a set of positive results that are different from those presented. Our negative results indicate that when the source of variability is development uncertainty or market requirement uncertainty, one cannot make a general statement about the impact of increased uncertainty. In some cases, the value of flexibility (and project value) increases and in others it decreases. On the other hand, if the source of variability is market payoff, we show that increased variability increases either the overall project value or the project option value. If the increased variability of market payoff increases the \u201cpassive\u201d value of the project, the overall project value also increases; and if it decreases the \u201cpassive\u201d value, the value of flexibility, i.e., the project option value, increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0387","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of R&D project management and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In addition to uncertain customer demands, the system experiences uncertain returns from customers. Some of the components in the returned products can be recovered and reused, and these units are returned to inventory. Returns complicate the structure of the system, so that the standard approach (based on reduction to an equivalent series system) no longer applies in general. We identify conditions on the item-recovery pattern and restrictions on the inventory policy under which an equivalent series system does exist. For the special case where only the end product (or all items used to assemble the end product) is recovered, we show that the system is equivalent to a series system with no policy restrictions. For the general case, we explain how and why the system becomes more problematic and propose two heuristic policies. The heuristics are easy to compute and practical to implement, and they perform well in numerical trials. Based on these numerical trials, we obtain insights into the impact of various factors on system performance. For example, we find that holding and backorder costs tend to increase when the average return rate, the variability of returns, or the number of components recovered increases. However, neither the product architecture nor the specific set of components being recovered seems to have a significant impact on these costs. Whether product recovery reduces total system costs depends on the magnitude of the additional holding and backorder costs relative to potential procurement cost savings.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0394","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or sustainability.

In the single moral-hazard case, the buyer\u2019s quality is observable, whereas in the double moral-hazard case, the buyer\u2019s quality is not observable. The supplier\u2019s quality is not observable in both the single and double moral-hazard cases. In each case, we examine a warranty/penalty contract between the buyer and the supplier based on information from incoming inspection and external failures. When the warranty contract is based on information from external failures in the single moral-hazard case, the first-best quality is achieved, whereas in the double moral-hazard case, the first-best quality is achieved if the supplier is not held responsible for the buyer\u2019s defects. When the warranty contract is based on information from incoming inspection, the first-best is achieved in both the single and double moral-hazard cases, even when the incoming inspection does not identify all of the supplier\u2019s defectives. An analysis of whether the penalty on the supplier in each case meets a fairness criterion\u2014that is, the penalty does not exceed the manufacturer\u2019s external failure cost\u2014indicates that the fairness criterion is met by the warranty contract based on information from incoming inspection when the first-best incoming inspection is sufficiently high.

Because anticipation of declining prices makes consumers less willing to invest in owning the durable good, selling can be self-defeating for the manufacturer. If the manufacturer instead leases the product, it can eliminate its own incentive to decrease the price over time, which allows it to extract larger rents from consumers. In this paper, we investigate how a durable goods manufacturer\u2019s choice between leasing and selling is affected by a complementary product that is produced by an independent firm. We show that a durable goods manufacturer that leases its product has an incentive to increase prices (by limiting the availability of the product) in response to the availability of a complement. Because this potential for opportunistic behavior discourages output of the complement, leasing can also be problematic. As a result, the durable goods manufacturer faces a trade-off between leasing, which commits the manufacturer to not overproduce, and selling, which commits it to not underproduce. Our contribution is to identify this trade-off and show how a durable goods manufacturer can use a combination of leasing and selling to balance its strategic commitment across both its own market as well as the complementary market.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0421","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on economic strategies related to durable goods without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Electronic retailers run the risk of overspending on advertising to attract customers but underspending on IT, thus resulting in inadequate processing capacity at the firm\u2019s website. In this paper, we present a centralized, joint marketing-IT model to optimally allocate spending between advertising and IT, and we discuss an uncoordinated case where marketing and IT make suboptimal advertising and capacity decisions. We show how these decisions can be coordinated either by reducing the value of a customer session or by designing an optimal processing contract between marketing and IT. Both the coordination methods can be implemented with only local knowledge of the IT function, yet they generate a solution that almost matches the quality of the centralized solution. We extend our basic model to consider demand uncertainty, lagged advertising effects, and uncertainties in the lead time to acquire IT capacity. With demand uncertainty, electronic retailers should reduce spending on advertising and increase IT capacity if there is potential for a demand upswing and the cost of IT capacity is relatively low. The value of a customer session should be further reduced when uncertainties exist. This is required to share the risk of excess or inadequate IT capacity.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0424","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of spending allocation between advertising and IT without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The empirical examination of BRM indicates that various categories of Web-design elements reinforce Web customers\u2019 beliefs, which in turn positively impact attitudinal constructs that lead to changes in their purchase intentions.

Assuming cumulative prospect theory, utility functions were elicited for gains and losses at an individual level using the tradeoff method. Subsequently, decision weights were elicited through certainty equivalents of uncertain two-outcome prospects. Furthermore, decision weights were decomposed using observable choice instead of invoking other empirical primitives, as in previous experimental studies. The choice-based elicitation of decision weights allows for a quantitative study of their characteristics, and also allows, among other things, for the examination of the sign-dependence hypothesis for observed choice under uncertainty. Our results confirm concavity of the utility function in the gain domain and bounded subadditivity of decision weights and choice-based subjective probabilities.

Sharing a demographic characteristic has been shown to strengthen a relationship between people. The initial explanation for this positive effect emphasized the importance of individual preferences for social contact. Similar people share common interests, which makes them more attractive as exchange partners. More recent explanations have highlighted the important role of identification and competition. Identification increases the tendency for strong ties to develop among similar people, while competition reduces that tendency. I argue that tie strength is a function of all three mechanisms: a baseline level of interpersonal attraction, a positive identification effect, and a negative competition adjustment. Identification and competition vary with the number of people sharing the focal attribute to define a predictable association between sharing the focal attribute and the strength of a network connection. Predictions are tested with tenure and tie-strength data from a small research and development firm. Analysis indicates that having the same tenure has the predicted effect on communication frequency.

The incremental contribution is driven by the individual customer\u2019s incremental choice probability for the brand in comparison to his choice probability for the underlying product with no brand-building efforts. The approach takes into account three sources of brand equity\u2014brand awareness, attribute perception biases, and nonattribute preference\u2014and reveals how much each of the three sources contributes to brand equity. This is done by taking into account not only the direct effects of these three sources on choice probabilities, but also the indirect effects through enhancing the brand\u2019s availability. The method provides what-if analysis capabilities to predict the likely impacts of alternative strategies to enhance a brand\u2019s equity.

In five studies, we demonstrate partition dependence for both discrete events and continuous variables (Studies 1 and 2), show that the bias decreases with increased domain knowledge (Studies 3 and 4), and that top experts in decision analysis are susceptible to this bias (Study 5). We relate our work to previous research on the \u201cpruning bias\u201d in fault-tree assessment (e.g., Fischhoff et al. 1978) and show that previous explanations of pruning bias (enhanced availability of events that are explicitly specified, ambiguity in interpreting event categories, and demand effects) cannot fully account for partition dependence.

The presence of background risk can change the optimal course of action with respect to a project, and ignoring such risk might lead to a poor decision. Most work on background risk assumes that project risk and background risk are independent and are additive in their impact on wealth. However, independence is often unrealistic, and background risk operates in a multiplicative manner in many situations. We relax the independence assumption and consider a model with both additive and multiplicative background risk. The optimal decisions in the correlated setting can be very different than those that would appear optimal if the correlation were ignored. The impact of correlation differs in the additive and multiplicative cases, with positive correlation being beneficial in some cases and negative correlation in others.

Even if demand is stationary, managers are held accountable for performance over a finite horizon. In a finite horizon, the fill rate is a random variable. Studying the distribution is relevant because a vendor may be subject to financial penalty if she fails to achieve her target fill rate over a specified finite period. It is known that for a zero lead time, base-stock model, the expected value of a finite-horizon fill rate exceeds the long-run fill rate. In this paper, I investigate the behavior of the distribution of the finite-horizon fill rate when a stationary base-stock policy is used to control inventory. For a vendor facing a finite-horizon, fill-rate-level contract and using a stationary stocking policy, I examine how the the length of the review horizon (i.e., monthly or quarterly), the demand distribution, and the cost of failing to meet the target affect the stocking decision.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1040.0064","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and performance metrics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, aligning it with a purely profit-focused perspective."],["2005","7","1","Retsef LeviRetsef Levirl227@cornell.eduSchool of ORIE, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853Search for more papers by this author, Martin P\u00e1lMartin P\u00e1lmpal@dimacs.rutgers.eduDIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854-8018Search for more papers by this author, Robin O.

The network model consists of a set of links and a set of possible routes that are fixed subsets of links. A connection is dynamically established along one of the routes to transmit data as requested and is terminated after the transmission is over. The transmission bandwidth of a link is dynamically allocated, according to specific bandwidth allocation policy, to ongoing connections that traverse the link. A network model is said to be stable under a given bandwidth allocation policy if, roughly, the number of ongoing connections in the network will not blow up over time. We consider a stationary and a bursty network model; the former assumes stochastically stationary arrival processes of connections as did many theoretical studies, while the latter allows more realistic bursty and correlated arrival processes. For both models under a necessary stability condition (i.e., the average offered transmission load on each link is within its bandwidth capacity), we show that the proportionally fair, the minimum potential delay, the max-min fair, and a class of utility-maximizing bandwidth allocation policies ensure network model stability, while some priority-oriented and maximum throughput policies do not. Interestingly, the bandwidth allocation policy that maximizes the arctan(\u00b7) utility ensures the stability of the stationary model but not the bursty model. This raises a serious concern about the current practice in the Internet protocol design, since such a policy is thought of as a good approximation of one of the most widely used TCP in the Internet.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0139","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of data network stability without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Each retailer faces some uncertain demand, and safety stock must be maintained to achieve suitable service levels. However, risk-pooling benefits may be achieved by allowing some retailers to serve as distribution centers for other retailers. The problem is to determine which retailers should serve as distribution centers and how to allocate the other retailers to the distribution centers. Shen et al. (2003) formulated this problem as a set-covering integer-programming model. The pricing problem that arises from the column generation algorithm gives rise to a new class of the submodular function minimization problem. In this paper, we show that by exploiting certain special structures, we can solve the general pricing problem in Shen et al. efficiently. Our approach utilizes the fact that the set of all lines in a two-dimension plane has low VC-dimension.

The algorithm adaptively chooses which action to sample as the sampling process proceeds and generates an asymptotically unbiased estimator, whose bias is bounded by a quantity that converges to zero at rate (ln N)/N, where N is the total number of samples that are used per state sampled in each stage. The worst-case running-time complexity of the algorithm is O((|A|N)H), independent of the size of the state space, where |A| is the size of the action space and H is the horizon length. The algorithm can be used to create an approximate receding horizon control to solve infinite-horizon MDPs.

We show that the optimal partition provided by an interior-point algorithm is particularly useful when designing the job lists. This follows because a strictly complementary solution to the linear programming relaxation observes all possible optimal solutions to the original binary problem.

In this general setting, we provide analytical results for the sales trajectories and life-cycle sales of the competing products. We use these results to study the impact of launch time on overall life-cycle sales. We consider the perspective of one of the competing products and model the trade-off between the lost revenues resulting from a delayed launch and the lower unit-production costs. We find that the profit-maximizing launch time exhibits a counterintuitive behavior. In particular, we show that a firm facing a launch time delay from a competing product might benefit from accelerating its own product launch, as opposed to using the softened competitive situation to further improve its cost position.

We analyze weighted Monte Carlo estimators that implement this idea by applying weights to independent replications. The weights are chosen to constrain the weighted averages of the control variables. We distinguish two cases (unbiased and biased), depending on whether the weighted averages of the controls are constrained to equal their expected values or some other values. In both cases, the number of constraints is usually smaller than the number of replications, so there may be many feasible weights. We select maximally uniform weights by minimizing a separable convex function of the weights subject to the control variable constraints. Estimators of this form arise (sometimes implicitly) in several settings, including at least two in finance: calibrating a model to market data (as in the work of Avellaneda et al. 2001) and calculating conditional expectations to price American options. We analyze properties of these estimators as the number of replications increases. We show that in the unbiased case, weighted Monte Carlo reduces asymptotic variance, and that all convex objective functions within a large class produce estimators that are very close to each other in a strong sense. In contrast, in the biased case the choice of objective function does matter.

In the class of dynamic resource allocation problems we consider, a set of reusable resources of different types has to be assigned to tasks that arrive randomly over time. The assignment of a resource to a task removes the task from the system, modifies the state of the resource, and generates a contribution. We build a decision-making scheme where the decisions regarding the resources in different sets of states are made by different agents. We explain how to coordinate the actions of different agents using nonlinear functional approximations, and show that in a distributed setting, nonlinear approximations produce sequences of min-cost network flow problems that naturally yield integer solutions. We also experimentally compare the performances of the centralized and distributed solution strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0166","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of resource allocation and decision-making without any mention of social themes, ethics, or diversity.

The cyclic scheduling policy is widely used in these systems in industry. Research on hoist scheduling has focused on the cyclic problem to minimize the cycle length. Most previous studies consider the single-hoist case. In practice, however, more than one hoist is often used in an electroplating line. This paper addresses the two-hoist, no-wait cyclic scheduling problem, in which the tank-processing times are constants and, upon completion of processing in a tank, the parts have to be moved to the next tank immediately. Based on the analysis of the problem properties, a polynomial algorithm is developed to obtain an optimal schedule. This algorithm first identifies a set of thresholds, which are special values of the cycle length, so that the feasibility property may change only at these thresholds. Feasibility checking is then carried out on each individual threshold in ascending order. The first feasible threshold found will be the optimal cycle length, and the corresponding feasible schedule is an optimal hoist schedule.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0167","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on a technical problem in operations management without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

The first service is delivered subject to a \u201cguaranteed\u201d (G) processing rate, and the second is a \u201cbest-effort\u201d (BE) type service in which residual capacity not allocated to the guaranteed class is shared among BE users. Users, in turn, are sensitive to both price and congestion-related effects. The service provider\u2019s objective is to optimally design the system so as to extract maximum revenues. The design variables in this problem consist of a pair of static prices for the two services, a policy that controls admission of G users into the system, and the mechanism by which users are informed of the state of congestion in the system. Because these objectives are difficult to address using exact analysis, we pursue approximations that are tractable and lead to structural insights. Specifically, we first solve a deterministic relaxation of the original objective to obtain a \u201cfluid-optimal\u201d solution that is subsequently evaluated and refined to account for stochastic fluctuations. Using diffusion limits, we derive approximations that yield the following structural results: (1) pricing rules derived from the deterministic analysis are \u201calmost\u201d optimal, (2) the optimal operational regime for the system is close to heavy traffic, and (3) real-time congestion notification results in increased revenues. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed approximations and validate the aforementioned structural insights.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0172","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service design and revenue maximization without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A novel methodology is developed in which firms\u2019 strategies are defined in terms of their location densities. This methodology leads to a model that is solvable analytically, and to several results on competitive location strategies. First, it is shown that if the follower decides to enter a market, he enters at least as strongly as the leader. Second, the leader can effectively deter entry even if she is severely cost-disadvantaged. However, in some cases the leader is better off by allowing the follower to enter the market. Third, the leader may also let the follower enter the market in some situations where she has a cost advantage. It is also shown that in situations where both firms enter the market, their location strategies are quite insensitive to model parameters.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0175","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive location strategies and profit maximization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The most difficult instance tested involves 17 long convoys each taking four times the average link travel time to pass through a point in the network. This instance is solved within 3.3% of optimality in less than 3.5 hours of computing time on a Dell Precision 420 dual processor computer.

A distinctive feature is that demand can be negative, representing returns from customers, as well as zero or positive. We observe that, as in a system with nonnegative demand, a stationary echelon base-stock policy is optimal here. However, the steady-state behavior of the system under such a policy is different from that in systems with nonnegative demands. We present an exact procedure and several approximations for computing the operating characteristics and system costs for any stationary echelon base-stock policy, and also describe an algorithm for computing a good policy. As an alternative to the echelon base-stock policy, we discuss a policy that uses only local information. Finally, we describe how to extend the analysis to the case where returns occur at multiple stages instead of just at the stage closest to demand, and the case where returns require a recovery lead time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0184","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory systems and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The current WHO strategy attempts to match the vaccine strains with the expected upcoming epidemic strains, a strategy we refer to as the follow policy. The recently proposed antigenic distance hypothesis suggests that vaccine efficacy can be enhanced by taking into account the antigenic histories of vaccinees. To assess the potential benefit of history-based vaccination, we formulate the annual vaccine-strains selection problem as a stochastic dynamic program using the theory of shape space, which maps each vaccine and epidemic strain into a point in multidimensional space. Computational results show that a near-optimal policy can be derived by approximating the entire antigenic history by a single reduced historical strain, and then solving the multiperiod problem myopically, as a series of single-period problems. The modest suboptimality of the follow policy, together with our current inability to quantitatively link the model\u2019s objective function (a measure of cross-reactivity) with actual vaccine efficacy, leads us to recommend the continued use of the follow policy.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0143","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical and scientific approach to vaccine selection without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The whole day service period is divided into a number of subperiods; during each subperiod, taxi supply and customer demand characteristics are assumed to be uniform. Customer demand is period-specific and described as a function of waiting time and taxi fare. Taxi operating cost for each work shift consists of two components: one component a function of total service time and the other component period-dependent. Each taxi driver can work for one or more shifts each day and freely chooses the starting and ending time of each shift. Equilibrium of taxi services is obtained when taxi drivers cannot increase their individual profits by changing their individual working schedules. A novel clock network representation is proposed to characterize the multiperiod taxi service equilibrium problem. The problem of interest is formulated as a network equilibrium model with path-specific costs and arc-capacity constraints, which can be solved using conventional nonlinear network flow optimization methods.

The models incorporated in current input-modeling software packages often fall short because they assume independent and identically distributed processes, even though dependent time-series input processes occur naturally in the simulation of many real-life systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a statistical methodology for fitting stochastic models to dependent time-series input processes. Specifically, an automated and statistically valid algorithm is presented to fit autoregressive-to-anything (ARTA) processes with marginal distributions from the Johnson translation system to stationary univariate time-series data. ARTA processes are particularly well suited to driving stochastic simulations.

We show that the problem is intimately related to a classical inventory staggering problem, where the focus is on the computation of the peak inventory level associated with the replenishment policy. This connection allows us to show that the delivery scheduling problem is NP-hard. For the two-vendor case with integral replenishment intervals, we propose a generalized form of Homer\u2019s scheduling heuristic and obtain performance bounds for the classical inventory staggering problem. Our analysis uses the Chinese remainder theorem in an interesting way. The approach can be generalized to the case with more than two vendors, leading to a strong linear-programming-based lower bound for the inventory staggering problem. We illustrate this technique for the case in which all the replenishment intervals are relatively prime, establishing a bound that is not greater than 140% of the optimal.

We introduce a dynamic produce-up-to policy that recovers the target cyclic schedule after a single disruption, and is also shown to be effective when disruptions are more frequent. Our policy is more flexible than traditional recovery policies in that our policy is able to adjust the amount of idle time observed during recovery in response to disruptions, and yet re-establish the target idle time as the schedule recovers. This results in a policy that not only saves cost and time, but provides better schedule stability than other recovery procedures. Furthermore, unlike simple produce-up-to policies, our policy is anticipatory\u2014replenishments will be speeded up or delayed, whichever is necessary, to help avoid congestion at the shared resource. In addition, recovery is controlled by a single \u201cknob\u201d or parameter that can tune recovery to be fast and aggressive (frequent setups and small batches) or slow and methodical (few setups and larger batches).

The second model (open-loop Cournot game) extends the Cournot model to include investments in new generation capacities. This model can be interpreted as describing investments in an oligopolistic market where capacity is simultaneously built and sold in long-term contracts when there is no spot market. The third model (closed-loop Cournot game) separates the investment and sales decision with investment in the first stage and sales in the second stage\u2014that is, a spot market.

When these constraints are in large numbers and the columns have on average more than 8\u201312 nonzero elements, column generation often becomes inefficient because solving the master problem requires very long solution times at each iteration due to high degeneracy. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a dynamic constraint aggregation method that reduces the number of set-partitioning constraints in the master problem by aggregating some of them according to an equivalence relation. To guarantee optimality, this equivalence relation is updated dynamically throughout the solution process.

This paper analyzes the first selection procedures that guarantee an upper bound for the expected opportunity cost, in a frequentist sense, of a potentially incorrect selection. The paper therefore bridges a gap between the indifference-zone approach (with frequentist guarantees, but for the P(CS)) and the Bayesian approach to selection procedures (which has considered the opportunity cost).

The first three classes are depicted as price-takers consistent with perfect competition. The pipeline operations are described with regulated tariffs, but also involve \u201ccongestion pricing\u201d as a mechanism to allocate scarce pipeline capacity. The marketers are price-takers in all markets except in sales to consumers, in which they compete as Nash-Cournot players. Finally, consumers are described by demand curves for each of the four sectors: residential, commercial, industrial, and electric power. We show that the equilibrium model is an instance of a mixed nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) and provide sufficient detail not generally seen in previous complementarity models of natural gas. The NCP formulation is derived from considering the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of the optimization problems faced by these participants. Under mild conditions, we show that this NCP has a solution, and under additional reasonable conditions, we show that the market prices are unique. We also validate the model on a representative sample network with nine market participants and three seasons, using four scenarios.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0199","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical model for natural gas markets without any mention of social justice, equity, or ethical considerations.

This issue is of primary importance in practice for statistical agencies when publishing data. It is assumed that the sensitive data have been identified by practitioners in the statistical offices, and the paper addresses the secondary problem of protecting these data with different methods, all defined in a unified mathematical framework. A common definition of protection is used in four different methodologies. Two integer linear programming models described in the literature for the cell suppression methodology are extended to work also for the controlled rounding methodology. In addition, two relaxed variants are presented using two associated linear programming models, called partial cell suppression and partial controlled rounding, respectively. A final discussion shows how to combine the four methods and how to implement a cutting-plane approach for the exact and heuristic resolution of the combinatorial problems in practice.

We do this by first considering two-station Markov decision process models and then studying three-station simulations. Our results show that the capacity of production lines with automatic machines can be significantly lower than the rate of the bottleneck. We also show that automating a manual machine can have a dramatic effect on the average work-in-process (WIP) level, provided that labor is the system bottleneck. Once a machine becomes the bottleneck, the benefits from further automation are dramatically reduced.

Numerical experiments show that the majorizing algorithm is stable and fast. In addition, we extend the method to fit other shapes, such as a square, an ellipse, a rectangle, and a rhombus by making use of the class of lp distances and dimension weighting. In addition, we allow for rotations for shapes that might be rotated in the plane.

We report an interpretive case study of an ERP system after its implementation in a large government agency. Despite the transformation agenda accompanying the new system, users initially chose to avoid using it as much as possible (inertia) and later to work around system constraints in unintended ways (reinvention). We explain the change in enactments with the concept of improvised learning, which was motivated by social influence from project leaders, \u201cpower users,\u201d and peers. Our results are consistent with arguments regarding the enactment of information technology in organizations and with temporal views of human agency.

The Effects of Trade Secret Protection Procedures on Employees' Obligations to Protect Trade Secrets","Organizations' trade secrets (which can be chemical formulae, recipes, customer files, machinery designs, or many other types of information) are often valuable, enduring sources of competitive advantage. In this study, the influence of organizations' formal efforts to protect trade secrets on employees' beliefs about their obligations to protect those secrets was investigated. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered by means of survey interviews with 111 employees of two high-tech organizations. Employees' obligations were influenced by their levels of familiarity with, and their perceptions of the enforcement of, two types of trade secret protection procedures (TSPPs): trade secret access restriction procedures (ARs) and trade secret handling procedures (HPs). Employees' levels of familiarity with ARs were negatively related to their felt obligations to protect trade secrets, but the opposite was true for HPs: Employees' levels of familiarity with HPs were positively related to the obligations they felt to protect trade secrets. For both types of TSPPs, the relationship between familiarity and felt obligations was moderated by employees' perceptions of the degree to which the TSPPs were enforced.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1040.0113","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['obligations', 'protection', 'employees']","The article primarily focuses on trade secret protection and employee obligations, which are more technical and centered on organizational practices rather than social justice or equity themes.

We construct an agent-based simulation in which multidepartment firms with different designs face environments whose turbulence and complexity we control. The model\u2019s results produce two sets of testable hypotheses. One set pinpoints formal designs that cope well with three different environments: turbulent settings, in which firms must improve their performance speedily; complex environments, in which firms must search broadly; and settings with both turbulence and complexity, in which firms must balance speed and search. The results shed new light on longstanding notions such as equifinality. The other set of hypotheses argues that the impact of individual design elements on speed and search often depends delicately on specific powers granted to department heads, creating effects that run contrary to conventional wisdom and intuition. Ample processing power at the bottom of a firm, for instance, can slow down the improvement and narrow the search of the firm as a whole. Differences arise between our results and conventional wisdom when conventional thinking fails to account for the powers of department heads\u2014powers to withhold information about departmental options, to control decision-making agendas, to veto firmwide alternatives, and to take unilateral action.

Yet, the concept of integration is ill-defined in the literature, and the impact of achieving high levels of integration is not well understood. The present paper addresses these issues. Drawing on the literature of several fields, this paper proposes the concept of organizational integration (OI), which is defined as the extent to which distinct and interdependent organizational components constitute a unified whole. Six types of OI are identified: two intraorganizational OI (internal-operational, internal-functional) and four interorganizational OI (external-operational-forward, external-operational-backward, external-operational-lateral, and external-functional). This paper then presents a model and develops 14 propositions to predict (1) the effort needed to implement different types of OI, (2) the impact different types of OI will have on organizational performance, and (3) how six factors (interdependence, barriers to OI, mechanisms for achieving OI, environmental turbulence, complexity reduction mechanisms, and organizational configurations) influence the relationship between OI types, implementation effort, and organizational performance. The OI framework and model are then used to develop 14 propositions for ERP implementation research and to explain the findings of recent research on integration.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0118","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational integration and performance without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical critiques.

The Effects of Social Networks and Institutional Sex Composition on the Job Search Outcomes of Elite Coeducational and Women\u2019s College Graduates","In this paper, I develop a perspective on women\u2019s career attainment focused on how employers\u2019 salary offers may be constructed based on their assumptions regarding women\u2019s access to comparative salary information. Therefore, although the use of social networks in job search may enhance women\u2019s actual knowledge of prevailing wages, I hypothesize that institutional characteristics that employers could assume to constrain women\u2019s networks and concomitant access to salary information will directly affect salary offers, as well as moderating the influence of network ties on pay. To test this perspective, job search outcomes of women attending elite coeducational and women\u2019s colleges were examined. Regarding the number of offers obtained, women who consulted with proportionally more male peer and employed adult male advice ties received significantly more job offers than women using fewer male advice contacts. With regard to salary offers, this study reveals an institutional sex composition effect: women exiting single-sex institutions (i.e., women\u2019s colleges) received significantly lower salary offers than women from coeducational schools, even after accounting for human capital, job characteristics, and institutional reputation. The effects of social networks on pay were moderated by institutional sex composition such that women exiting women\u2019s colleges received lower returns in the form of salary to their cross-gender advice ties than did women from a matched coeducational institution. Implications of these results for theories of social capital and women\u2019s occupational attainment are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0119","","OS","Management & Organizations","8","['women', 'salary offers', 'social networks', 'institutional sex composition', 'occupational attainment']","The article focuses on women's career outcomes and salary disparities based on institutional sex composition, highlighting issues of gender equity and social networks in job searches.

This paper contributes to emerging work on boundary theory by examining the extent to which individuals desire to integrate or segment their work and nonwork lives. This desire is conceptualized and measured on a continuum ranging from segmentation (i.e., separation) to integration (i.e., blurring) of work and nonwork roles. We examine the fit between individuals\u2019 desires for integration/segmentation and their access to policies that enable boundary management, suggesting that more policies may not always be better in terms of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Using survey methodology and a sample of 460 employees, we found that desire for greater segmentation does moderate the relationship between the organizational policies one has access to and individuals\u2019 satisfaction and commitment. People who want more segmentation are less satisfied and committed to the organization when they have greater access to integrating policies (e.g., onsite childcare) than when they have less access to such policies. Conversely, people who want greater segmentation are more committed when they have greater access to segmenting policies (e.g., flextime) than when they have less access to such policies. Moreover, the fit between desire for segmentation and organizational policy has an effect on satisfaction and commitment over and above the effects of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income, number of children, and the ages of those children.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0124","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['work-family policies', 'boundary management', 'segmentation', 'integration', 'organizational commitment']","The article discusses work-family policies and their impact on employees' desires for segmentation versus integration of work and nonwork roles, reflecting moderate themes of DEI and ethical organizational practices.

First, the spontaneous facet of improvisation tends to be overemphasized, and second, there is a general assumption that improvisation always leads to positive performance. Our goal is to clear up the conceptual confusion about improvisation by laying out the various aspects of preparation that are required for effective improvisation. In our theoretical model, we delineate how the improvisational theater principles of \u201cpractice,\u201d \u201ccollaboration,\u201d \u201cagree, accept, and add,\u201d \u201cbe present in the moment,\u201d and \u201cdraw on reincorporation and ready-mades\u201d can be used to understand what it takes to improvise well in work teams and to create a context favoring these efforts. Our findings support a contingent view of the impact of improvisation on innovative performance. Improvisation is not inherently good or bad; however, improvisation has a positive effect on team innovation when combined with team and contextual moderating factors. We also provide initial evidence suggesting that the improvisational skill can be learned by organizational members through training. Our results shed light on the opportunities provided by training in improvisation and on the challenges of creating behavioral change going beyond the individual to the team and, ultimately, to the organization.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0126","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['collaboration', 'training', 'innovation']","The article discusses themes of collaboration and training in the context of team performance and innovation, which are relevant to organizational practices.

In an enterprise-focused era, reputation is a key strategic construct that can act as a boundary object linking communities within and between organizations. Yet approaches to its management tend to be reactive and remain under the hold of industrial society principles. Definitions of reputation risk in the existing literature and the business community have a tendency to be static and asset oriented. We suggest that this contrasts sharply with insights on the social construction of knowledge that inform recent risk studies. Drawing on this critique, we argue that the ambivalence engendered by on-going processes of definition (responsibilities, boundaries, fact construction) characterizing the knowledge society demands a reconceptualization of reputation risk. We propose a reconceptualization of reputation risk that not only incorporates a more sophisticated view of reputation, but also acknowledges the role that risk and trust relations can play in its constitution. In addition to contributing to the theoretical development of reputation risk in the organization studies literature, we develop the notion of reputable action as a guiding principle for realizing active trust development in the practical management of reputation risk.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0127","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['reputation', 'trust', 'social construction', 'risk', 'communities']","The article discusses the social construction of reputation risk and emphasizes the importance of trust and community relations, indicating a moderate focus on ethical considerations and social dynamics in organizational management."],["2005","16","3","Phyllis A.

The system of arrangements and procedures for doing work affects all workers every day throughout the world. Work is changing dramatically. In an increasingly global and knowledge-intensive economy, work design is no longer contained within an organization; it often transcends the boundaries of organizations and countries. These changes call for a renewed research focus on work design. Building on configuration and complexity perspectives, we propose a framework for studying work design. We argue that three issues require attention to advance the knowledge of work design: (1) defining the boundaries of work systems, (2) examining how the system is nested in a hierarchy within and between organizations, and (3) determining interactions between the elements of a work system. We propose a method of frontier analysis for identifying equifinal designs\u2014the set of equally effective work designs for different combinations of inputs (situations or contexts) and outputs (performance criteria).

While economists and sociologists have explained the location of industry clusters on the basis of unevenly distributed resources, and historians have provided rich descriptive insight into the developmental dynamics of particular metropolitan regions, little systematic theory has been advanced to explain cross-regional inflows and outflows of resources, especially with respect to patterns in cluster development. This paper examines the concept of regional industrial identity as a social code that (1) arises from the shared understandings of residents and external audiences about the suitability of a region for particular kinds of business activity and (2) influences decisions about where to locate investments. We argue that such understandings are principally informed by configurations of industry clusters that have already formed in a region. Clusters, which are the results of historical investments, are also important signals about the types of business that can thrive in the future. We develop theoretical propositions linking characteristics of regional industry cluster configurations, in particular cluster dominance and cluster interrelatedness, to the strength and focus of regional identity and, as a result, to the types and amounts of resources that will develop within and flow into and out of regions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0131","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['regional identity', 'social code', 'investment decisions']","The article discusses the concept of 'regional industrial identity' and its influence on investment decisions, hinting at social dynamics in economic development.

However, accomplishing this will require a somewhat different approach to theory building and testing. We illustrate the process of building an integrated model from fundamental constructs by using the idea of self-enhancement to explore phenomena of power and influence. We argue that many psychological processes related to power and social influence (such as escalation of commitment, similarity attraction and in-group favoritism, the disinhibiting effects of power, and the persistence of hierarchical structures) can all be logically derived from the self-enhancement idea, the desire to see oneself and one\u2019s actions in a positive light.

In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0133","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['sensemaking', 'identity', 'action', 'emotion']","The article discusses the concept of sensemaking in organizational theory, emphasizing identity and action, which hints at social dimensions.

To illustrate these advantages, we provide examples of an implicit approach to conducting full-cycle research and present suggestions for fostering more explicit full-cycle research programs in the future.

A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in financial economics. These approaches reflected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversification, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of financial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the field rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change\u2014such as our own era.

Grounded in this research, we develop a framework that identifies how some specific forms of cognitive schemas (i.e., rule schemas, event schemas, person schemas) and specific contexts (e.g., physical contexts, institutional contexts) interact during sensemaking processes to give rise to momentary perceptions that we call situated cognitions. We present evidence that common patterns of interaction between schemas and context may occur during sensemaking in organizations. In terms of theoretical implications, our framework focuses attention on the specific interactions between context and cognition (rather than on context or cognition alone) that comprise situated cognitions, and helps to more concretely define situated cognitions as momentary or temporally bounded perceptions. We offer several practical implications of this framework for managers and suggest avenues for further elaboration on our ideas through research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0138","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['cognition', 'context', 'schemas']","The article primarily focuses on cognitive schemas and organizational context without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We attribute this neglect to our field\u2019s philosophical, theoretical, and methodological fealty to the precepts of equilibrium and linearity. We argue that ingrained assumptions and habituated methodologies dissuade organizational scientists from grappling with problems to which these ideas and tools do not apply. Nevertheless, equilibrium and linearity are assumptions of social theory, not facts of social life. Drawing on four empirical studies of organizational fields in flux, we suggest new intellectual perspectives and methodological heuristics that may facilitate investigation of fields that are far from equilibrium. We urge our colleagues to transcend the general linear model, and embrace ideas like field configuration, complex adaptive systems, self-organizing networks, and autocatalytic feedback.

Efficiency takes a legal-ownership view of atomistic boundary decisions.

Second, we juxtapose these conceptions with the current literature to create a springboard for a renewed research agenda.

We argue that this separation of domains is problematic. The economics literature, for example, is unable to explain why organizations should find it difficult to change incentive structures in the face of environmental change, while the organizational literature focuses heavily on the role of inertia as sources of organizational rigidity. Drawing on recent research on incentives in organizational economics and on cognition in organizational theory, we build a framework for the analysis of incentives that highlights the ways in which incentives and cognition\u2014while being analytically distinct concepts\u2014are phenomenologically deeply intertwined. We suggest that incentives and cognition coevolve so that organizational competencies or routines are as much about building knowledge of \u201cwhat should be rewarded\u201d as they are about \u201cwhat should be done.\u201d We argue that this recognition has important implications for our understanding of organizational inertia in the face of environmental change, and that it opens up important new areas for further research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0154","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['incentives', 'organizational rigidity', 'environmental change']","The article discusses the interplay between incentives and organizational behavior, touching on themes of organizational rigidity and environmental change.

It argues that such research has focused excessively on the quasi-automatic, routine-based aspects of capability development, and largely neglected the roles played by cognition and organizational hierarchy. By deriving a model of search that jointly considers how routine-based and cognitive logics of action coexist within an organizational hierarchy to affect capability development, this article offers three contributions. First, it delineates the traits of a microfoundational structure for research on capabilities that begins to address these gaps. Second, based on this structure, it highlights previously neglected causal mechanisms that contribute to our understanding of how capabilities develop. The model shows that managers\u2019 cognitive representations of their strategic decision problem fundamentally drive organizational search, and therefore the accumulation of capabilities. Furthermore, it shows that the accuracy of the representations a manager chooses might vary according to where she is situated in the organizational hierarchy. This more refined perspective leads to a set of propositions regarding how different hierarchical arrangements influence capability development and organizational performance. Finally, the paper sets an agenda for future research in this area.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0140","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['capabilities', 'organizational hierarchy', 'cognition']","The article discusses organizational hierarchy and cognition in the context of capability development, but it does not explicitly address social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques, which are key indicators of wokeness.

Various streams of literature implicitly assume that financial markets influence firm strategies, yet the specifics of these interactions are not well specified. Motivated by a case study of the retail brokerage industry, this study proposes three particular characteristics of learning from financial markets. First, there is vicarious learning from outcomes (e.g., stock valuations), yet this has characteristics that are more similar to institutional forms of mimetic isomorphism. Second, the forward-looking and complex nature of financial valuations incites a paradoxically simplified type of crude heuristic learning. Third, there is a mutual and simultaneous learning process in that firms learn from financial markets, which in turn are themselves in a process of social construction. This combination of special characteristics suggests a number of learning pathologies that center around an increasing likelihood (compared with other types of learning and adaptation) of falling prey to misleading signals. A computer simulation, based on a model in which Cournot duopolists play a multistage game involving investment and cost reduction, explores the implications of these characteristics and pathologies in a systematic way.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0141","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['learning', 'financial markets', 'firm behavior']","The article focuses on the technical aspects of firm behavior and financial markets without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We present a framework for understanding TMSs as learning systems that affect group learning and learning transfer, and we test the major outcomes of the framework in an empirical study. We found that groups with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles relevant to the task domain\u2014a critical factor for learning transfer in general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a TMS affects members\u2019 ability to apply prior learning and develop a collective, abstract understanding of the task domain.

This study develops and tests a model that examines how top managers\u2019 sensemaking of rankings affects organizational change. Specifically, the model proposes direct and moderated effects of a perceived discrepancy between the position assigned to an organization in the rankings and the position implied by the organization\u2019s identity in the minds of its top managers (referred to here as a \u201cperceived identity-reputation discrepancy\u201d), on the extent of change undertaken by the organization.

The results show that, as expected, schools whose top managers believed that their rankings were discrepant from their own perceptions of their school\u2019s standing in the industry, were more likely to undertake organizational change. This relationship was moderated by top managers\u2019 perceptions of the strategic impact of the rankings, and by the strength and external orientation of organizational identity; the relationship was not moderated by the perceived validity of the rankings. Overall, the results suggest that managerial interpretations and organizational identity work in concert to explain variation across organizations in the extent to which rankings motivate organizational change.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0144","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['reputational rankings', 'organizational change', 'identity']","The article discusses organizational change in response to reputational rankings, which touches on themes of identity and perception but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or ethical critiques.

This paper considers why routines that are performed flexibly may nonetheless persist over time. Drawing on data from participant observation of a high-tech manufacturing company, I identify factors that contribute to both the flexibility and persistence of a routine. First, individuals and groups approach routines with different intentions and orientations, suggesting that agency shapes particular routine performances. Second, routine performances are embedded in an organizational context that, while it may not restrict the flexible use of a routine, may constrain its ongoing adaptation. Finally, accounting for the relative power of individuals sheds light on the interaction between agency and context in routine performance and explains why the actions of some individuals, but not others, can change routines. This paper draws on recent work that conceptualizes routines as ongoing accomplishments, and it extends it by identifying how actors and contexts shape both individual performances of routines and contribute to their persistence or change over time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1050.0150","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['agency', 'organizational context', 'flexibility']","The article discusses the role of agency and organizational context in shaping routines, which touches on themes of flexibility and adaptation but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or equity.

Furthermore, they are worthy of study because they constitute a significant sector of the economy, whether measured by their size, numbers, or influence. Despite their significance, little is known of the determinants of their performance. This paper proposes that the core tasks of PSFs raise unusual strategic and organizational challenges, the resolution of which affects organizational performance. We elaborate the effects of reputation and diversification and contrast them to theory for goods-producing industries. We also hypothesize that PSF managers face a choice in designing structures between the retention and motivation of the professional workforce and transferring knowledge from partners to other professionals. These predictions are tested and supported by data from the largest 100 U.S. accounting firms for the period 1991\u20132000.

Moreover, the dynamic pricing policy for each product generation is obtained as a function of the firm's market entry strategy and manufacturing efficiency.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00016.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing and market strategies without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Motivated by our experience at a major U.

Capacity\u2010allocation is carried out by the corporate headquarters (HQ), which allocates manufacturing capacity to product lines based on demand information reported by the PMs. We show that PMs have an incentive to manipulate demand information to increase their expected allocation, and that a carefully designed coordination mechanism is essential for HQ to implement the optimal allocation. To this end, we design an incentive scheme through bonus payments and participation charges that elicits private demand information from the PMs. We show that the mechanism achieves budget\u2010balance and voluntary\u2010participation requirements simultaneously. The results provide important insights into the treatment of misaligned incentives in the context of semiconductor capacity\u2010allocation.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00017.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of semiconductor capacity allocation and incentive schemes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This research develops an empirical QM model in a technology\u2010based sector\u2014electronics manufacturing. Based on quantitative and qualitative investigations of 225 electronics firms in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China, a path analytic model is developed. The empirical model shows that a typical quality management system (QMS) in the electronics industry is composed of four major modules, namely leadership, cultural elements, operational support systems, and process management. These modules create a series of chain effects on organizational performance, rather than acting as parallel elements with an equal impact. By quantifying their effects on organizational performance and comparing the model to others in the literature, we identify those QM constructs that are context dependent. In electronics manufacturing, process management and customer focus are more important than other elements (e.g., cultural factors) for garnering business results. This study contributes to contingency theory and research by identifying the key constructs and their relationships in a competitive, volatile, and technology\u2010based industry with complex supply networks.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00018.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical research related to quality management in the electronics industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We develop a diffusion and substitution model based on a somewhat different perspective. In some cases, progressive improvements in product attributes and/or continual cost reduction seem to be a key driver of the diffusion process. For example, after introduction of the 5.25\u2010inch disk drive, its capacity continually increased, and accordingly, so did customer willingness\u2010to\u2010pay. Our model is based on a linear reservation price framework, in which a product is described by its depth (defined as the difference between a product\u0302s maximum reservation price and its production cost), and its breadth (related to the slope of its reservation price curve), indicating how broadly it appeals across various customer segments. Because of changes in product depths and breadths over time, customers who previously preferred the old product may later prefer the new product, thus creating the diffusion process. While the Bass model describes diffusion as a function of the coefficients of innovation and imitation, in our model, it is described by the coefficients of depth and breadth (the rates of change in relative depth and breadth), along with an S\u2010coefficient that we associate with the technology S\u2010curve.

The axiomatic decomposition for conceptual design method combines Alexander's network partitioning formulation of the design problem with Suh's Independence Axiom. The axiomatic decomposition method uses a cross\u2010domain approach in a House of Quality context to estimate the interactions among the functional requirements that are derived from a qualitative assessment of customer requirements. These interactions are used in several objective functions that serve as criteria for decomposing the design network. A new network partitioning algorithm is effective in creating partitions that maximize the within\u2010partition interactions and minimize the between\u2010partition interactions with appropriate weightings. The viability, usability, and value of the axiomatic decomposition method were examined through analytic comparisons and qualitative assessments of its application. The new method was examined using students in engineering design capstone courses and it was found to be useable and did produce better product designs that met the customer requirements. The student\u2010based assessment revealed that the process would be more effective with individuals having design experience. In a subsequent assessment with practicing industrial designers, it was found that the new method did facilitate the development of better designs. An important observation was the need for limits on partition size (maximum of four functional requirements.) Another issue identified for future research was the need for a means to identify the appropriate starting partition for initiating the design.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00025.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical methodology for product design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Before manufacturing can begin, either these Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), or a Contract Manufacturer (CM) needs to adopt the process technology, i. e., make a capacity investment in it. Due to market uncertainty, the timing of capacity investment is crucial. In such a setting, we investigate how the timing of process adoption, an important determinant of time\u2010to\u2010market, is impacted by the make/buy decision. We first characterize the optimal time for process adoption and show that this delay depends on competitive intensity, cost structure and the rate of forecast improvement. Due to differing cost structures, incentives and risks, an OEM and a CM may invest in a new process technology at different times. We show that while there are conditions where outsourced manufacturing can be advantageous for the OEM from a time\u2010to\u2010market perspective, there are also cases where the OEM would be disadvantaged. In these cases, the OEM can accelerate process adoption by risk sharing through joint investment. Finally, the right choice of CM is extremely important for an OEM that faces a short time window for product introduction: An efficient CM not only provides low costs but also rapid access to new process technologies, and therefore higher revenues.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00026.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of outsourced manufacturing and timing of entry in markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this paper, we broaden the scope of the make\u2010buy decision to include product design decisions, as well as production decisions. First, we examine independently the decisions of whether to internalize design and production, and then we consider how design and production organizational decisions are interdependent. The specific research questions we address are: (1) How can design and production sourcing decisions be described in richer terms than \u201cmake\u201d and \u201cbuy\u201d? (2) Do existing theories of vertical integration apply to product design activities as well as production decisions? (3) What is the relationship between the organization of design and the organization of production? (4) What organizational forms for design and production are seen in practice?

If, however, the issuer can create a derivative security that is collateralized by the assets, pooling and \u201ctranching\u201d may be optimal. If the residual risk of each asset is not highly correlated, tranching allows the issuer to exploit the risk diversification effect of pooling to create a low-risk and highly liquid security. In contrast, for an uninformed seller, pure pooling reduces underpricing and is preferred to separate asset sales. These results lead to a dynamic model of financial intermediation: originators sell pools of assets, some of which are purchased by informed intermediaries who then further pool and tranche them. Pooling and tranching allow intermediaries to leverage their capital more efficiently, enhancing the returns to their private information.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/1/1/1592277","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses purely on technical financial mechanisms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are central to the concept of wokeness."],["2005","18","1","Jun Liu\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Jun Liu\n            \n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Anderson School at UCLA\n    \n\n    \n        Address correspondence to: Jun Pan, MIT Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, MA 02142, or e-mail: junpan@mit.edu.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Jun Pan\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Jun Pan\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        MIT Sloan School of Management, CCFR and NBER\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Tan Wang\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Tan Wang\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Sauder School of Business at UBC and CCFR\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","An Equilibrium Model of Rare-Event Premia and Its Implication for Option SmirksGet access","This article studies the asset pricing implication of imprecise knowledge about rare events. Modeling rare events as jumps in the aggregate endowment, we explicitly solve the equilibrium asset prices in a pure-exchange economy with a representative agent who is averse not only to risk but also to model uncertainty with respect to rare events. The equilibrium equity premium has three components: the diffusive- and jump-risk premiums, both driven by risk aversion; and the \u201crare-event premium,\u201d driven exclusively by uncertainty aversion. To disentangle the rare-event premiums from the standard risk-based premiums, we examine the equilibrium prices of options across moneyness or, equivalently, across varying sensitivities to rare events.

However, if the managers and owners of the firms included in the transaction remain involved in the business as shareholders and directors, operating and stock price performance improve, and future acquisitions are better received by the market.

In fact, for many announced programs no shares are ever actually repurchased. This article explores this puzzle. In the single-firm-type version of the model, the option that a firm grants itself by announcing a program does not generate announcement returns. In equilibrium, long-run gains from the informed trading that the option creates are offset by short-run costs from the market's accounting for this adverse selection. Based on this trade-off, I construct a signaling (two-type) model that can deliver announcement returns. In the separating equilibrium, good firms do not incur any cost when they announce programs. Their gains from informed trading in the long run offset the cost of announcement incurred in the short run. Mimicry is costly, because a bad firm's long-run gains from informed trading cannot compensate for the short-run cost of announcing.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/1/271/1592244","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of stock repurchase programs and their financial implications without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

We strongly reject a variety of univariate diffusion models for daily Eurodollar spot rates and some popular multivariate affine term structure models for monthly U.S. Treasury yields.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/1/37/1592259","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial modeling without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, indicating a purely technical and profit-focused approach."],["2005","18","1","Tarun Chordia\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Tarun Chordia\n            \n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Emory University\n    \n\n    \n        Address correspondence to: Asani Sarkar, The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, NY 10045, or e-mail: asani.sarkar@ny.frb.org.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Asani Sarkar\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Asani Sarkar\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Avanidhar Subrahmanyam\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Avanidhar Subrahmanyam\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of California at Los Angeles\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","An Empirical Analysis of Stock and Bond Market LiquidityGet access","This article explores cross-market liquidity dynamics by estimating a vector autoregressive model for liquidity (bid-ask spread and depth, returns, volatility, and order flow in the stock and Treasury bond markets).

Using a variety of specifications, we find robust evidence consistent with this \u201crevealed preference\u201d hypothesis. Further demonstrating the key role played by control considerations in managers' stockholding decisions, the reductions in ownership are concentrated in management teams with higher levels of initial ownership and in firms without poison pills.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/2/637/1599844","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of managerial ownership and antitakeover legislation without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

These parameters are subject to estimation bias when standard methods are used. The estimation bias can be substantial even in very large samples and much more serious than the discretization bias, and it translates into a bias in pricing bond options and other derivative securities that is important in practical work. This article proposes a very general and computationally inexpensive method of bias reduction that is based on Quenouille's (1956; Biometrika, 43, 353\u2013360) jackknife. We show how the method can be applied directly to the options price itself as well as the coefficients in the models. We investigate its performance in a Monte Carlo study. Empirical applications to U.S. dollar swap rates highlight the differences between bond and option prices implied by the jackknife procedure and those implied by the standard approach. These differences are large and suggest that bias reduction in pricing options is important in practical applications.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/2/707/1599901","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing bond options and does not address any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Under the model setup, we show that the optimal controls are constant over time, and thus the optimal menu consists of contracts that are linear in the final outcome. We also show that when a moral hazard problem adds to an adverse selection problem, the monotonicity condition well known in the pure adverse selection literature needs to be modified to ensure the incentive compatibility for information revelation. The model is applied to a few managerial compensation problems involving managerial project selection and capital budgeting decisions. We argue that in the third-best world, the relationship between the volatility of the outcome and the sensitivity of the contract depends on interactions between the managerial cost and the firm\u2019s production functions. Contrary to conventional wisdom, sometimes the higher the volatility, the higher the sensitivity of the contract. The firm receiving good news sometimes chooses safer projects or invests less than it does with bad news.

To accomplish this task, we suggest new empirical measures based on the disagreement among analysts about expected earnings (short-term and long-term) and show they are good proxies. We first establish that the heterogeneity of beliefs matters for asset pricing and then turn our attention to estimating a structural model in which we use the forecasts of financial analysts to proxy for agents\u2019 beliefs. Finally, we investigate whether the amount of heterogeneity in analysts\u2019 forecasts can help explain asset pricing puzzles.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/3/875/1617727","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and the impact of heterogeneous beliefs on financial models, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2005","18","3","Thierry Post\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Thierry Post\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        Erasmus University Rotterdam\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Haim Levy\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Haim Levy\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        The Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar","Does Risk Seeking Drive Stock Prices?

Moreover, delay captures part of the size effect, idiosyncratic risk is priced only among the most delayed firms, and earnings drift is monotonically increasing in delay. Frictions associated with investor recognition appear most responsible for the delay effect. The very small segment of delayed firms, comprising only 0.02% of the market, generates substantial variation in average returns, highlighting the importance of frictions.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/3/981/1617714","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market frictions and price responses without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

When uncertainty dispersion is large, investors with high uncertainty choose not to participate in the stock market, resulting in limited market participation. When limited participation occurs, participation rate and equity premium can decrease in uncertainty dispersion and a conglomerate trades at a discount.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/4/1219/1595874","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of market participation and model uncertainty without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

It is demonstrated that the expected dollar return of a stock is independent of managerial incentives and idiosyncratic risk, but the equilibrium price of the stock depends on them. Thus, the expected rate of return is affected by managerial incentives and idiosyncratic risk. It is shown, however, that managerial incentives and idiosyncratic risk affect the expected rate of return through their influence on systematic risk rather than serve as independent risk factors. It is also shown that the risk aversion of the principal in the model leads to less emphasis on relative performance evaluation than in a model with a risk-neutral principal.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/4/1253/1595730","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing and moral hazard without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Markets are incomplete, and investors have recursive preferences defined over intermediate consumption. The paper obtains a solution to this problem which is exact for investors with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption and approximate otherwise. The optimal portfolio demand for stocks includes an intertemporal hedging component that is negative when investors have coefficients of relative risk aversion larger than one, and the instantaneous correlation between volatility and stock returns is negative, as typically estimated from stock return data. Our estimates of the joint process for stock returns and precision (or volatility) using U.S. data confirm this finding. But we also find that stock return volatility does not appear to be variable and persistent enough to generate large intertemporal hedging demands.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/18/4/1369/1595886","articles","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on consumption and portfolio choice under stochastic volatility, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Drawing on organizational capabilities and knowledge-sharing research, we develop a situated performance view that holds that the value of obtaining and using knowledge within a firm depends on the task situation. Using a data set of 182 sales proposals for client work in a management consulting company, we show that sales teams that had varying needs to learn and differentiate themselves from competitors derived different levels of value from obtaining and using electronic documents and advice from colleagues. Highly experienced teams were more likely than inexperienced teams to lose the sales bids if they utilized such knowledge. Teams that had a high need to differentiate themselves from competitors also had a lower chance of winning if they utilized electronic documents. There were situations, however, where teams performed better if they utilized the firm's knowledge resources. These results suggest that competitive performance depends not on how much firms know but on how they use what they know.

A newly developed constrained, multi-objective, classification methodology is modified to empirically derive an alternative quantitative typology using survey data obtained from 709 firms in three countries (China, Japan, United States). We compare the Miles and Snow typology to the classification empirically derived utilizing this combinatorial optimization clustering procedure. With respect to both variable battery associations and objective statistical criteria, we show that the empirically derived solution clearly dominates the traditional P-A-D-R typology of Miles and Snow.

A study in the software services industry","Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in the notion of capabilities as an important source of competitive advantage. This recognition has, in turn, placed emphasis on the question of where and how these capabilities emerge and how they influence firm performance. The present paper is an attempt to address this question. Using a large sample of detailed project-level data from a leading firm in the global software services industry, we attempt to empirically study the importance of capabilities. We find that two broad classes of capabilities are significant. The first class, which we label client-specific capabilities, is a function of repeated interactions with clients over time and across different projects. This learning from repeated interactions with a given client reduces project execution costs and helps improve project contribution. The second class, termed project management capabilities, is acquired through deliberate and persistent investments in infrastructure and systems to improve the firm's software development process. Our empirical results suggest that the marginal returns to acquiring different capabilities may be different and an understanding of such trade-offs can improve firm decisions to improve and/or acquire such capabilities. We discuss the key contributions of our paper and the implications for future research on capabilities.

Three literatures speak to this question. Transaction cost economics focuses on the value of internalization, the literature on inter-firm relationships on the value of past relationships, and the firm capabilities literature on the value of superior capabilities. Choosing a supplier means choosing a bundle of these characteristics\u2014internal vs. external, amount of prior transactions, and capabilities\u2014but no study has integrated all three characteristics, making it impossible to understand the trade-offs involved either theoretically or managerially. I propose and test a model integrating all three factors, allowing us to understand the trade-offs involved. I find that when uncertainty is low, the decision is made primarily on the basis of differences in technical capabilities. As uncertainty increases, prior relationships and a supplier being internal take on greater positive significance relative to the importance of technical capabilities. At extreme levels of uncertainty, the value of internal supply relationships becomes very high and past relationships lose their significance. While adherents of each literature have criticized the others for what they omit, this model moves beyond this mutual recrimination by incorporating the key concerns of each literature, setting the stage for future research that draws upon the strength of each. The model provides guidance for any situation where a firm must chose a partner under uncertainty. Lastly, it addresses the strategic question of how companies should organize in the long run to access the capabilities needed for competitive success.

Using a sample of manufacturing firms in the United States and India, we show that superior firm performance in emerging economies persists only as much as developed economies in line with the revisionist argument. We also provide evidence consistent with the accepted view that poor firm performance persists longer in emerging economies compared to developed economies. Further exploration of the latter shows that, contrary to predictions of extant theories, firms in emerging economies that are affiliated with an MNC or a business group have a greater persistence of poor performance than firms that are unaffiliated with these intermediate governance structures, and hence would be better off operating at arm's length.

In a sample of large law firms we find that, even though firms profit from expert human-capital leveraging strategy and service and geographical diversification strategies individually, pursuing these strategies simultaneously at high levels produces negative interaction effects on firm profitability. In addition, the internally developed, firm-specific associate human capital strategically fits better with high levels of expert human-capital leveraging. While lateral hiring helps firms build new knowledge bases and take advantage of growth opportunities, pursuing high levels of both expert human-capital leveraging and lateral hiring of associates results in lower profitability. To fully capture the economic benefits from strategies of diversification, human-capital leveraging and lateral hiring, firms should understand and manage the complex interdependencies among multiple levels of strategy.

To complement the transaction cost perspective's emphasis on the need to control and limit opportunistic behavior, we examine the sources and impact of the cooperation costs incurred in order to work with a partner. We propose that these costs increase with greater joint task complexity and interpartner diversity, and perceptions of equitable behavior affect the perceptions of these costs. Hypotheses derived from the framework are tested in a sample of 231 contractual alliances between architects and general contractors in the Hong Kong construction industry. We find that both cooperation costs and transaction costs affect the level of time and effort a manager expends on an alliance, supporting our fundamental proposition that the costs of cooperation and control are conceptually and empirically distinct. We argue that cooperation costs should be incorporated into studies that compare the choice of alternative partners and alliance structures, as well as among the broader categories of market, hierarchy, and hybrid governance forms.

This research examines two large longitudinal samples of firms to discover which industries, if any, exhibit performance that is consonant with Schumpeterian theory and the assertions of hypercompetition. We find support for the argument that over time competitive advantage has become significantly harder to sustain and, further, that the phenomenon is limited neither to high-technology industries nor to manufacturing industries but is seen across a broad range of industries. We also find evidence that sustained competitive advantage is increasingly a matter not of a single advantage maintained over time but more a matter of concatenating over time a sequence of advantages.

While prior experience should increase collaborative benefits from the current alliance, I expect these returns: (1) to be most beneficial when alliance activities are more uncertain; and (2) to diminish at high levels of experience. Results from a sample of 464 R&D alliances in the telecom equipment industry generally match these expectations. The positive benefits of prior experience in complex alliances suggest that a broader set of alliance management processes allows the firm to manage situations of ambiguity more readily. The lack of cumulative benefits from prior experience appears to be partly due to knowledge depreciating over time, since only recent experience has a positive impact on collaborative returns. Overall, these results provide empirical evidence of the effect of prior experience on collaborative benefits, both directly and conditionally on alliance characteristics, and have implications for learning to manage organizations more generally.

Further, stock market response to alliance partner and type is also affected by the change in environmental munificence between the two periods.

A reply to McNamara, Aime, and Vaaler","We revisit the questions of identification of outlying firms within industries and their impact on the relative importance of firm- and industry-specific factors for firm performance. In response to McNamara, Aime and Valler (2005), we argue that the key results in Hawawini, Subramnian and Verdin (2003) are insensitive to the varying methods used to identify firm outliers. Further, we argue that conducting tests on industry outliers are inconsistent to what is indicated by theory and past empirical results on the relative importance of firm and industry effects to firm performance.

We suggest that the degree to which downsizing will improve firm performance will be contingent on conditions under which the downsizing occurs. We emphasize the level of organizational slack as an important contingency, and also examine two other contingencies: (1) whether the scope of the downsizing is narrow (restricted to personnel reductions) or broad (involves organizational redesign); and (2) if the downsizing is conducted proactively (when performance is stable or improving) or reactively (when performance is declining). By analyzing a panel dataset of downsizings conducted by the 100 largest American industrial firms from 1977 to 1993, we find broad support for our hypotheses that downsizings are more likely to lead to improved performance when firms have high slack, when their scope of the downsizing is broad, and when the downsizing is done proactively. We also explore and find evidence for interactions among these contingencies. We discuss the implications of our findings for the literatures on downsizing and organizational slack. In doing so, we bring together two literatures that have an obvious affinity but have been only loosely coupled in the past.

Despite the growing and widespread importance of foreign-based competition, the influence that such competition may exert on corporate diversification strategy is a question largely overlooked in the strategic management literature.

We consider how productive capability differences can shape vertical scope through gains from trade. Using highly detailed data from the mortgage banking industry, we find productive capabilities to be a key determinant of the make-vs.-buy decision. Our analysis also suggests firms' attempts to leverage a comparative advantage can also lead to the use of mixed governance modes (both \u2018make\u2019 and \u2018buy\u2019 in a particular part of the value chain).

Some studies find that incumbents cut prices post entry, while others find that incumbents accommodate entry by leaving prices unchanged (or even raising prices). To better understand these findings, this study explores the conditions under which incumbents are more likely to cut prices when faced with entry. I argue that incumbents vary in their incentives to cut prices; incumbents with greater incentives are more likely to respond aggressively to entry. Using data on magazine subscription prices, I find that, on average, incumbent magazines do not reduce prices following entry. But, the results suggest that newer incumbents cut prices more than older incumbents, while incumbents that compete in fewer and in more competitive markets cut prices less following entry. These results help to explain inconsistent empirical results in the literature, and support a more general explanation of when firms respond aggressively to entry: incumbents respond to entry more aggressively when their incentives to do so are greater.

It synthesizes the resource-based view of diversification and the economic theory of complementarities to conceptualize cross-business knowledge synergies in terms of the relatedness and the complementarity of knowledge resources across business units of the multibusiness firm. The study hypothesizes that corporate performance is improved when the firm simultaneously exploits a complementary set of related knowledge resources across its business units. In a sample of 303 multibusiness firms, the study finds that synergies arising from product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, or managerial knowledge relatedness do not improve corporate performance on their own.

An analysis of Japanese pharmaceutical firms","Internationalizing research and development is often advocated as a strategy for fostering the development of technological capabilities. Although firms conduct international R&D to tap into knowledge bases that reside in foreign countries, we argue that in order to benefit from international R&D investments firms must already possess research capabilities in underlying or complementary technologies. We examine the international R&D expansion activities, research capabilities, and patent output of 65 Japanese pharmaceutical firms from 1980 to 1991. We find that firms benefit from international R&D only when they possess existing research capabilities in the underlying technologies. In addition to refining our understanding of when international R&D enhances firm innovation, our results integrate asset-seeking and asset-based theories of foreign direct investment. Internationalizing R&D to tap into foreign knowledge bases is consistent with asset-seeking theories of foreign direct investment, while the contingent nature by which firms benefit from international R&D is consistent with asset-based theories of foreign direct investment and the notion of absorptive capacity.

What has been largely missing in the literature is the temporal dimension, i.e., the changes over time in key variables such as organizational environment, firm strategic adaptations, and the performance implications. In this study, we investigate environment and strategic adaptations 12 years after Tan and Litschert examined these issues in 1990. Following a staged model, the study found that (1) organizational environment and firm strategic adaptations have co-evolved over time, (2) a new configuration has emerged and is related to improved performance, and (3) such a relationship is moderated by the stage during transition in which firms were founded. Specifically, firms founded since 1990 are more proactive and innovative than firms that had existed in the previous stage.

The influence of ethics codes on financial executives' decisions","With the recent spate of scandals resulting from the questionable behavior of corporate leaders, there have been calls for various governance mechanisms including ethics codes to guide executive decision-making. However, the extent to which ethics codes are actually used by executives when making strategic choices as opposed to being merely symbolic is unknown. We develop our hypotheses by combining stakeholder management theory and the theory of planned behavior, and test them with a survey of 302 senior financial executives (e.g., CFOs, VPs of Finance). We find that financial executives are more likely to integrate their company's ethics code into their strategic decision processes if (a) they perceive pressure from market stakeholders to do so (suppliers, customers, shareholders, etc.); (b) they believe the use of ethics codes creates an internal ethical culture and promotes a positive external image for their firms; and (c) the code is integrated into daily activities through ethics code training programs. The effect of market stakeholder pressure is further enhanced when executives also believe that the code will promote a positive external image. Of particular note, we do not find that pressure from non-market stakeholders (e.g., regulatory agencies, government bodies, court systems) has a unique impact on ethics code use.

Capabilities are conceived as the efficiency with which a firm employs a given set of resources (inputs) at its disposal to achieve certain objectives (outputs). We expand on extant theoretical literature on relative capabilities, by delineating the conditions that have to be met for relative capabilities to be measured non-tautologically. We then proceed to suggest an estimation methodology, stochastic frontier estimation (SFE), that allows us to infer firm capabilities. We illustrate this technique with a sample of firms in the semiconductor industry. Our findings underscore the heterogeneity in R& D capability across firms in this industry, as well as the persistence in these capabilities over time. We also find that the market rewards high R& D capability firms, in that they show the highest average values of Tobin's q.

Using data covering the period 1995\u201398 pertaining to venture capital firms and their holdings in initial public offerings (IPOs), we show that both product niche and process niche interact with network embeddedness to determine firm performance.

Results from SEM two-group analyses (with controls) show that both main effects positively impact performance in both environmental contexts.

Unlike previous research which focuses on parent firm factors, the study examines value in light of the reason behind the termination of the venture and the characteristics of the target market. Consistent with the real options view, the paper finds that ventures divested to refocus a parent firm's product market portfolio were associated with significant value creation. In contrast, ventures acquired with the objective of growth and expansion in a target market, while not associated with significant value creation, did not destroy value either. Apart from these results, the paper also finds that acquirers and divesters gained lesser value when they terminated ventures in uncertain and concentrated industries. These latter findings highlight an important caveat with regard to termination: joint ventures confer valuable flexibility which is also forgone once they are terminated. Implications are discussed.

The concept of \u2018core self-evaluation\u2019 (CSE), which has been recently validated in the psychology literature, concisely encompasses and consolidates the common, overlapping portions of four previously unconnected personality dimensions: self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of control, and emotional stability. CSE has great potential to provide substantial leverage for research on executive self-concept. We review and reconcile prior research on related constructs in executive settings (including narcissism, hubris, and overconfidence) and argue that CSE should be adopted as a robust, well-validated umbrella construct for research on executive self-concept. Indeed, a very high level of CSE, or hyper-CSE, aligns closely with what is often colloquially called \u2018hubris.\u2019 We anticipate that hyper-CSE executives\u2014who possess supreme levels of self-confidence, self-potency, and conviction that they will prevail\u2014will manifest this trait in their job behaviors. We develop a set of integrated propositions that describe the implications of CSE for strategic decision processes, strategic choices, and organizational performance.

In this paper, we analyze how the process of retail deregulation affects the comparative efficiency of governance structures, which range on a continuum from fully vertically integrated structures to market transactions. Based on the analysis of 177 U.S. electric utilities from 1998 to 2001, our results show that the process of retail deregulation has a negative impact on firms' productive efficiency, as measured using Data Envelopment Analysis. Furthermore, firms that are vertically integrated into electricity generation, or that rely on the market for the supply of their electricity, are more efficient than firms that adopt hybrid structures combining vertical integration and contracting. This research has important implications because it shows the coexistence of different types of governance structures that cope efficiently with regulatory uncertainty through different mechanisms.

We draw on the concepts of differentiation and integration to dimensionalize the adaptive capacity of different modes of procurement. Using data on all component classes procured internally and externally by Ford and Chrysler, we show that different procurement modes differ in terms of their adaptive capacity and performance.

Specifically, we argue that capability differences are a necessary condition for vertical specialization; and that transaction cost reductions only lead to specialization when capabilities along the value chain are heterogeneous. Furthermore, we argue that there are four evolutionary mechanisms that shape vertical scope over time. First, the selection process, itself driven by capability differences, dynamically shapes vertical scope; second, transaction costs are endogenously changed by firms that try to reshape the transactional environment to increase their profit and market share; third, changes in vertical scope affect the nature of the capability development process, i.e., the way in which firms improve their operations over time; and finally, the changes in the capability development process reshape the capability pool in the industry, changing the roster of qualified participants. These dynamics of capability and transaction cost co-evolution are illustrated through two contrasting examples: the mortgage banking industry in the United States, which shows the shift from integrated to disintegrated production; and the Swiss watch-manufacturing industry, which went from disintegration to integration.

While transaction costs are a major source of value dissipation, reducing such dissipation may create value. Implications for the RBV analysis of sustained competitive advantage are derived.

Regional configurations focused on Asia are chosen by firms with weaker competitiveness for products with established manufacturing technologies. Plant configurations focused on the United States and the European Union are chosen by technology-intensive firms facing competitive threats in foreign markets. Global configurations are chosen by firms with a strong competitive position in the Japanese and world market for their core product businesses and are more common in the case of strong oligopolistic rivalry between Japanese firms.

In theory, resource sharing should yield economic benefits in related multi-business firms, but the extensive empirical research remains equivocal. To explore this paradox, this paper examines the process of implementing a related diversification strategy. Working from existing theory, a formal model is constructed that describes the process and performance implications of a related diversification move. The model is analyzed using computer simulation, and the analysis suggests that successful diversification strategies require managerial policies that maintain organization slack. In the absence of such policies, related diversification can negatively impact firm performance even when substantial synergy opportunities exist. The analysis also demonstrates, contrary to existing theory, that diversification strategies based on a very high degree of relatedness can lead to lower performance than less related strategies in some circumstances. Counter-intuitively, extracting potential synergies may require additional investment in shared resources.

Two research hypotheses argue for the existence of asymmetric rivalry in the sense that strategic groups of small companies have a greater degree of response but a slower speed of response to the actions of strategic groups of large companies, than vice versa. To test this, we use an ex post approach that examines the news releases published on the strategic actions and reactions of firms. A third hypothesis compares ex ante competitive expectations with ex post asymmetric rivalry between strategic groups. To test this, we compare ex post news on actions/reactions with an ex ante approach that estimates conjectural variations. The empirical application carried out on bank deposits in the Spanish market defines strategic groups in terms of size due to the historical and institutional conditions of the industry (deregulatory change). The results obtained show that rivalry patterns between strategic groups in terms of company size can be predicted as asymmetric in the sense that smaller bank strategic groups have a greater degree of response (Stackelberg \u2018leader\u2013follower\u2019 competitive interaction), and a slower speed of response to the actions of larger bank strategic groups than is found the other way around. Moreover, ex ante expectations of aggressiveness on the part of larger strategic groups characterize greater ex post reactions from the smaller-size strategic groups. Therefore, the size distribution of strategic groups is valuable to research on complex industries with deregulation changes.

We argue that the cost of distance differentially affects investment motivations across industries. We find support for this hypothesis in a study of U.S. inward and outward FDI. Knowledge seeking and efficiency seeking are the two most important explanations for international activity in information-intensive industries, reinforcing the value of intangible resources in this sphere. In less information-intensive industries, market seeking and the search for low-cost export platforms are the dominant motivations for FDI. An important implication for the current debate on offshoring is that inward FDI flows into the United States occur in high- rather than low-paying industries, and are of the knowledge-seeking variety, while outward flows are driven by the search for efficiency and markets.

Absent pure luck, this requires managers to exercise foresight about a resource's future value and/or complementarities with pre-existing capabilities. This foresight grants managers the opportunity to exploit information asymmetries for personal gain as well as building organizational capabilities. Nevertheless, there is limited research on the extent of foresight or how managers use it. In our study of insider trading, we found that managers purchase stock well before breakthrough patents are filed. We argue for further research on the extent of managerial foresight and how it affects rent generation and appropriation.

We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries.

The role of particularism and universalism in shaping research outcomes","As the field of strategy reaches its 25th anniversary, we examine how far the field has progressed during that time. Both management and strategy research have been characterized as being in an early stage of development. We draw on Kuhn's (1996) paradigm development model, which posits a connection between a field's stage of maturity and research processes and outcomes, to assess the maturity of the strategy field. We conduct two studies. The first is a cross-discipline comparison of productivity norms for university faculty. The second study examines longitudinal research outcomes for a sample of 945 strategy faculty. Our results indicate that strategy has the attributes of both an early stage and mature field: while overall research norms are low relative to other fields, they are driven far more by merit-based than non-merit factors.

We find significant interrelationships between export and domestic sales with striking differences between Spanish-owned firms and foreign-owned firms operating in Spain. For Spanish-owned firms, domestic and export sales are complements. These firms appear to focus on the domestic market and strength in the domestic market drives their export sales. In contrast, domestic and export sales are substitutes for foreign-owned firms. These firms' export strategies appear subsumed under strategies of managing a multinational network in which the focus is sales outside of Spain. We discuss the importance of these findings for understanding and managing export strategies.

Moreover, firm profit influenced the relation between wages and effort. Workers provided higher effort when firm profit decreased compared to when it increased.

To test our model, we conduct two studies in which M.B.A. students judge the risk of a broad range of financial items. Our results indicate that both the decisiontheory variables and Slovic's (1987) behavioral variables are important in explaining investors' risk judgments. Further, we demonstrate that information about the amount of potential loss outcome contained within mandated risk disclosures not only directly influences risk judgments, but also indirectly affects such judgments via its effect on some of Slovic's (1987) behavioral variables. By identifying this unintended consequence of current risk disclosures, these results have the potential to influence the way accounting regulators, firm managers, and academic researchers think about risk disclosure.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/1/221/2810/How-Do-Investors-Judge-the-Risk-of-Financial-Items","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['risk', 'behavioral', 'disclosures']","The article primarily focuses on a risk model for financial items, integrating conventional decision-theory and behavioral variables, with little emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

Critics of this Accounting Bulletin stated that it would eliminate industry\u2010accepted revenue recognition practices and reduce the quality of reported earnings. The FASB's revenue recognition discussions echo these concerns stating that revenues recorded prior to the completion of the earnings process contain value\u2010relevant information about future performance. This paper investigates these two hypotheses using a sample of firms that accelerated revenue recognition prior to SAB No. 101 adoption (SAB 101 firms) and a matched set of firms that were unaffected by this regulation (unaffected firms). Our earnings distribution tests indicate that SAB 101 firms are more likely to meet earnings benchmarks. Specifically, we find that, in the pre\u2010adoption period, SAB 101 firms report fewer small negative and more small positive earnings than they do in the post\u2010adoption period and than do unaffected firms in the pre\u2010adoption period; SAB 101 firms report fewer small negative and more small positive earnings changes in the pre\u2010adoption period compared to the post\u2010adoption period. We also document that SAB 101 firms are more likely to have weaker corporate governance and more likely to have financial covenants, providing them with greater incentives to manage earnings. However, we find that the association between earnings and future cash flows and between unexpected earnings and earnings announcement period returns were higher for SAB 101 firms than for unaffected firms in the preadoption period, indicating higher earnings informativeness for SAB 101 firms. These associations declined for SAB 101 firms in the post\u2010adoption period, suggesting that SAB No. 101 caused a decline in earnings informativeness. Overall, our results suggest that, although the revenue recognition practices targeted by SAB No. 101 have been used by some firms to manage earnings, the regulation's prohibition of revenue recognition prior to completion of the earnings process, on average, results in less informative earnings since these unearned revenues provide value\u2010relevant information.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/2/373/2823/The-Effects-of-Accelerated-Revenue-Recognition-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting practices and regulatory impacts without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques that would indicate a 'woke' theme."],["2005","80","2","Orie E.

We provide empirical evidence consistent with these theories. Specifically, announcements that increase analysts' private information (as measured by Barron et al.'s [1998] empirical proxies) are associated with increased trading volume, consistent with some investors similarly acquiring private event\u2010period information. In addition, announcements that decrease analysts' consensus are associated with more trading volume. Because consensus declines when private information increases, this finding provides reinforcing evidence that investors trade following earnings announcements because of private information that becomes useful only in conjunction with the information in the announcement and that this information is important enough to spur trading.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/2/403/2776/Evidence-That-Investors-Trade-on-Private-Event","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of trading and private information related to earnings announcements, with no mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics."],["2005","80","2","Lawrence D.

(1999) type methodology to quarterly data for the 1985\u20132002 time period, we show that, since the mid\u20101990s, but not before then, managers seek to avoid negative quarterly earnings surprises more than to avoid either quarterly losses or quarterly earnings decreases. Our findings suggest that the quarterly earnings threshold hierarchy proposed by Degeorge et al. (1999) does not apply to recent years, and that managers' claim that avoiding quarterly earnings decreases is the threshold they most seek to achieve (Graham et al. 2004) is inconsistent with their actions. We provide an intuitively appealing economic rationale for why the shift in threshold hierarchy occurred; since the mid\u20101990s, but not before then, investors unambiguously rewarded (penalized) firms for reporting quarterly earnings meeting (missing) analysts' estimates more than they did for meeting (missing) the other two thresholds. We provide several explanations for why investors unambiguously reward firms for reporting quarterly earnings that meet or beat analysts' estimates more than for meeting the other two thresholds late (but not early) in our sample period: increased media coverage given to analyst forecasts, more analyst following, more firms covered by analysts, and temporal increases in both the accuracy and precision of analyst forecasts.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/2/423/2825/A-Temporal-Analysis-of-Quarterly-Earnings","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical analysis of earnings thresholds and investor behavior without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Using stock\u2010based compensation and stock ownership data over the 1993\u20132000 time period, we document that managers with high equity incentives sell more shares in subsequent periods. As expected, we find that managers with high equity incentives are more likely to report earnings that meet or just beat analysts' forecasts. We also find that managers with consistently high equity incentives are less likely to report large positive earnings surprises. This finding is consistent with the wealth of these managers being more sensitive to future stock performance, which leads to increased reserving of current earnings to avoid future earnings disappointments.

On the one hand, formal controls such as sanctioning and monitoring systems improve cooperation by reducing the incentives for opportunistic behavior. On the other hand, prior research finds that the mere presence of a control system causes decision makers to view the collaborative setting as noncooperative, and other collaborators as untrustworthy. In this paper, we conduct two experiments in which participants act as business collaborators. Through these experiments, we examine the effects of control on trust and cooperation in collaborative settings. Specifically, we posit and provide evidence that a strong control system can enhance the level of trust among collaborators. The mediating role of control\u2010induced cooperation provides the mechanism by which control systems can increase trust in collaborative environments. Furthermore, we show that this increased trust has a positive effect on the subsequent level of cooperation among collaborators. Taken together, the results suggest an increasing marginal benefit of control system strength arising from the trust that control\u2010induced cooperation engenders. The implication is that firms will choose to implement a stronger control system than previous research would seem to suggest.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/2/477/2818/The-Effect-of-Control-Systems-on-Trust-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['trust', 'cooperation', 'control systems']","The article primarily focuses on managerial accounting and control systems without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Moreover, the simplest proxy, which is based on the least reasonable assumptions, contains no more measurement error than the remaining proxies. These results remain even after we attempt to purge the proxies of their measurement error via the use of instrumental variables and grouping.

Specifically, fraud firms have fewer numbers and percentages of outside board members, fewer audit committee meetings, fewer financial experts on the audit committee, a smaller percentage of Big 4 auditing firms, and a higher percentage of CEOs who are also chairmen of the board of directors. However, the results indicate that fraud firms take actions to improve their governance, and three years after fraud detection these firms have governance characteristics similar to the control firms in terms of the numbers and percentages of outside members on the board, but exceed the control firms in the number of audit committee meetings. I also investigate whether the improved governance influences informed capital market participants. The results indicate that analyst following and institutional holdings do not increase in fraud firms, suggesting that credibility was still a problem for these firms. However, the results also indicate that firms that take actions to improve governance have superior stock price performance, even after controlling for earnings performance.

The results of our experiment indicate that firm output and employees' compensation are greater when the employer does not have discretion over total employee compensation, but does have discretion over the allocation of total compensation. We find that the employer's residual profit increases with discretion over the allocation of compensation among employees; however, we find no effect on residual profit of the employer's discretion over the total amount of employee compensation. Our results suggest that firms benefit from a compensation contract that establishes total employee compensation as a predetermined function of public, aggregate measures such as accounting income, but provides the employer at least some discretion to allocate this compensation using private information.

The empirical results are based on a comparison of companies disclosing such internal control problems with a control sample of companies changing auditors but not disclosing internal control problems. Audit committee quality is measured in three dimensions: its size, its independence, and its expertise. The internal control problems are observed at two levels of increasing seriousness: reportable conditions and material weaknesses. The sample time period precedes the effective dates of recent policy changes regarding audit committees.

We use a linear contracting framework to investigate the effects of profit\u2010sharing rules on individual partners' various decisions, including their pricing strategies and effort choices.We assume that efficient audits of different types of clients require different effort profiles with respect to degree of partner cooperation. For example, the audit of a complex company requires different amounts of partner collaboration than does the audit of a simple company. Moreover, since it is too costly for an enforcement party, such as the head office of an audit firm or a court, to verify each client's type in order to resolve compensation disputes among the firm's partners, it is reasonable to assume that client type cannot be contracted upon for partner compensation purposes. Given this assumption, we derive conditions under which there exists an equilibrium in which audit firms strategically choose different profit\u2010sharing rules to specialize in different types of clients, thereby earning positive economic profits. Our analysis provides insights into the strategic competition among the big audit firms, and helps to explain the observed differences in the compensation plans of these firms and in the nature of their client portfolios.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/2/677/2768/Profit-Sharing-in-an-Auditing-Oligopoly","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on profit-sharing rules and optimal partner behavior in auditing firms without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We examine this set of firms because they likely had the strongest incentives to withhold segment information and analysts potentially had the most to gain when these firms were forced to begin providing segment disclosures under SFAS No. 131. We find that these firms used the latitude in SFAS No. 14 to hide profitable segments operating in less competitive industries than their primary operations. However, we find no evidence to suggest that these firms used the latitude in SFAS No. 14 to mask poor performance. In contrast, our results suggest that by withholding segment information, these firms allowed themselves to appear as if they were underperforming their competition when this was not the case. Thus, their decision to withhold segment disclosures under SFAS No. 14 appears to be motivated by a desire to protect profits in less competitive industries. In terms of the impact of SFAS No. 131 on analysts' information environment, our evidence suggests that SFAS No. 131 increased analysts' reliance on public data, but we provide weak evidence to suggest that this shift may have come at the cost of a marginal increase in overall uncertainty and squared error in the mean forecast.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/3/751/2842/Managers-Motives-to-Withhold-Segment-Disclosures","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['disclosures', 'segment', 'incentives']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of financial disclosures and managerial incentives without addressing social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

The FERC is the association between current\u2010year returns and next\u2010year earnings. SFAS No. 131, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997, arguably increased both the quantity and quality of segment disclosure. Consistent with the standard's intended qualitative effects, pre\u2010131 multi\u2010segment firms experienced a significant increase in FERC after adopting SFAS No. 131. Consistent with the standard's intended quantitative effects, many pre\u2010131 single\u2010segment firms began disclosing multiple segments, and those that did experienced an increase in FERC. However, pre\u2010131 single\u2010segment firms that remained single segment (i.e., were unaffected by SFAS No. 131) had no change in FERC, indicating that the increase in FERC for 131\u2010affected firms is not due to some other event concurrent to the adoption of SFAS No. 131. These results are robust under numerous procedures that control for characteristics of the sample firms and their earnings, providing strong evidence that SFAS No. 131 resulted in an increase in stock price informativeness for affected firms. Thus, we provide the first empirical price\u2010based evidence that SFAS No. 131 provided more information (about future earnings) to the market, as the standard's proponents have suggested.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/3/773/2837/The-Impact-of-SFAS-No-131-Business-Segment-Data-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of accounting standards and their impact on market predictions without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

We find that on average investors price transitory losses positively over the sample period, as if a transitory loss indicates a low likelihood of exercising the abandonment option. We also observe that early in the sample period investors do not price persistent losses, as predicted by the abandonment option hypothesis. By contrast, later in the sample period, larger persistent losses correspond to higher returns, inconsistent with the prediction of the abandonment option hypothesis. To understand why we observe a change in the valuation of persistent losses over the sample period, we study their components and establish the key role of R&D for their valuation. We find that investors do not price persistent losses without an R&D component, consistent with these losses indicating financial distress and a higher likelihood of exercising the abandonment option. However, when persistent losses contain R&D, investors separately value the R&D component as an asset and the non\u2010R&D component as if it is a transitory loss. Thus, investors do not consider losses to be homogeneous, but consider the causes and nature of the loss to assess its long\u2010term implications for firm value.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/3/847/2846/Valuing-Loss-Firms","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial metrics related to loss firms and investor behavior without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical considerations.

The cumulative approach compares to net income the total amount of misstatement existing at the end of the current period, while the current\u2010period approach compares to net income the amount of misstatement added in the current period. Depending on the relation between total misstatement and current\u2010period misstatement, either the cumulative approach or the current\u2010period approach can calculate higher quantitative materiality. This paper reports an experiment that varies materiality approach between auditors by providing auditors with either the current\u2010period or cumulative formats used by their firm to summarize proposed audit adjustments. Results indicate that, across a variety of experimental contexts (varying misstatement size, subjectivity, precision, and income effect, and varying whether auditors document effects on their client's quality of earnings), auditors are more likely to require their client to book the misstatement under the approach that makes the misstatement appear more material. These results suggest that standard setters mandate that auditors require adjustment whenever a misstatement is material under either approach.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/3/897/2844/The-Effect-of-Quantitative-Materiality-Approach-on","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of auditing practices and quantitative materiality without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This study examines whether the holistic perspective that auditors acquire in making a strategic risk assessment influences the extent to which they adjust account\u2010level risk assessments when they encounter changes in accounts that are inconsistent with information about client operations. Based on halo theory from the performance evaluation literature, we hypothesize that auditors who (1) perform (do not perform) strategic assessment, and (2) develop favorable (unfavorable) strategic risk assessments, are less (more) likely to adjust account\u2010level risk assessments for inconsistent fluctuations. Data from two laboratory experiments using experienced auditors support both hypotheses.

Our sample is based on firms that experience abnormal short interest increases (\u201cshort spikes\u201d) during 1989\u20131998. We find that the mean abnormal return around short spike announcements is significantly more negative for firms with low analyst following, consistent with short sellers providing perceived value when there are limited alternative sources of guidance available. For firms with high analyst following we find the market response is dependent on earnings levels, consistent with investors viewing a short interest increase as providing information about the sustainability of earnings. Additional analyses reveal that these inferences are not affected by measures of firms' earnings quality or by the relative size of the short spike. We infer from our analyses that the information content of short interest disclosures is conditional on both the firms' existing information environment and expectations of future performance as conveyed by prior earnings. This inference is consistent with short sellers' role as information intermediaries covering the lower tail of earnings expectations.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/3/941/2826/The-Information-Intermediary-Role-of-Short-Sellers","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of short selling and market responses without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2005","80","3","Anne Wyatt\n\n                    \n\n    \n        \n    Anne Wyatt\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        University of Melbourne.\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    This Site\n\n\n    \n        PubMed\n    \n    \n        Google Scholar","Accounting Recognition of Intangible Assets: Theory and Evidence on Economic Determinants","This paper examines the extent to which management makes accounting choices to record intangible assets based on their insights into the underlying economics of their firm.

We examine (1) the determinants of emphasis placed on pro forma and GAAP earnings within quarterly earnings press releases, (2) whether there has been a shift away from emphasizing pro forma earnings toward GAAP earnings, and (3) whether stock market reactions to earnings news were influenced by emphasis placed on metrics within the press release. We find that firms emphasize metrics that are more value\u2010relevant and portray more favorable firm performance. We also find that the extent of a firm's media coverage affects managers' emphasis decisions. Further, our results indicate a highly significant shift toward GAAP emphasis and away from pro forma emphasis in 2002 relative to 2001. Finally, our stock market tests suggest that greater emphasis on an earnings metric results in a stronger market reaction to the surprise in that metric.

Using a sample of 78 startup companies, we document cross\u2010sectional differences in the adoption of operating budgets as well as seven other management accounting systems. We find that our proxies for agency costs, perceived benefits and costs, company scale, and top management style explain cross\u2010sectional differences in the time\u2010to\u2010adoption of budgets. In particular, the presence of venture capital, CEO experience, presence of a financial manager, number of employees, and the CEO beliefs about management planning systems are associated with this adoption decision. We further investigate the effect of hiring a financial manager as an endogenous variable. In the first stage of a two\u2010stage model, we find that CEO experience, the presence of venture capital funds, CEO beliefs about management accounting systems, and number of employees are associated with crosssectional variation in this hiring decision. When treating this decision as endogenous, time\u2010to\u2010hiring a financial manager is unrelated to operating budget adoption. The paper also examines the association between the time\u2010to\u2010adoption of operating budgets and company performance. We find a significant increase in the number of employees of the company around the adoption of operating budgets; moreover, faster adoption of operating budgets is associated with faster growing companies. We extend the findings to additional management accounting systems including: cash budgets, variance analysis, operating expense approval policies, capital expenditure approval policies, product profitability, customer profitability, and customer acquisition costs.

In a rational expectations equilibrium model, we find that earnings quality increases with tighter standards, but we identify several consequences that may outweigh this benefit. First, managers increase costly real earnings management because the higher earnings quality increases the marginal benefit of real earnings management. Second, tighter standards can increase rather than decrease expected accounting and total earnings management. Third, the expected total costs of earnings management can also increase.

Using a sample from 34 countries, we find that firms in industries with greater external financing needs have higher voluntary disclosure levels, and that an expanded disclosure policy for these firms leads to a lower cost of both debt and equity capital. Crosscountry differences in legal and financial systems affect observed disclosure levels in predicted ways.

Determining these weights is a cognitively difficult task, and archival research shows that observed performance\u2010measure weights are only partially consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Ittner et al. (2003) have concluded that psychology theory can help to explain such inconsistencies. In an experimental setting based on Feltham and Xie (1994), we use psychology theories of reasoning to predict distinctive patterns of similarity and difference between optimal and actual subjective performance\u2010measure weights. The following predictions are supported. First, in contrast to a number of prior studies, most individuals' decisions are significantly influenced by the performance measures' error variance (precision) and error covariance. Second, directional errors in the use of these measurement attributes are relatively frequent, resulting in a mean underreaction to an accounting change that alters performance measurement error. Third, individuals seem insufficiently aware that a change in the accounting for one measure has spillover effects on the optimal weighting of the other measure in a two\u2010measure incentive system. In consequence, they make performance\u2010measure weighting decisions that are likely to result in misallocations of agent effort.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/4/1163/2840/Effects-of-Accounting-Method-Choices-on-Subjective","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting method choices and performance measure weighting without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

In particular, managers are accused of using earnings guidance to exert undue influence on analyst forecasts. This paper analyzes optimal incentive contracts that take into account the interaction between analysts and firm managers. In our setting, biased earnings guidance is a natural consequence of contract design. The bias serves to create enough uncertainty so as to motivate the analyst and, thus, may not necessarily be the scourge suggested by conventional wisdom.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/4/1193/2845/The-Role-of-Biased-Earnings-Guidance-in-Creating-a","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['biased', 'influence', 'analysts']","The article discusses biased earnings guidance and its implications for the relationship between managers and analysts, but it does not engage with social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques in a significant way.

Using bid\u2010ask spread and share turnover as proxies for information asymmetry, I find that after the introduction of SFAS No. 86, information asymmetry decreases for software firms relative to that of other high\u2010tech firms. Within the software industry, I find that information asymmetry is significantly lower for firms that capitalize (capitalizers) than for those who expense (expensers) software development costs. Thus, accounting for software development costs per SFAS No. 86 reduces information asymmetry and, consequently, the cost of capital. As well, investors' uncertainty about the future benefits of software development costs is reduced when firms capitalize these costs.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/80/4/1211/2834/Accounting-for-Software-Development-Costs-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting standards and their impact on information asymmetry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We examine incentives induced by the litigation environment, insider trading activities, firm financial distress, and industry concentration.
