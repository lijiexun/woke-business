An institutional change emerged out of an interaction between selection at the level of sector and imitative adoption at the firm level. We argue that market feedback regarding the novel structure fostered its legitimacy.

Linking ecological and economic research on organizations, we propose that the effects of rivals' horizontal, upstream, and downstream alliances are determined by the degree to which they (1) foreclose a focal firm's alliance opportunities and (2) increase industry carrying capacity.

We show how an overaccumulation of interruptions can shift an organizational system from a resilient, self-regulating regime, which offsets the effects of this accumulation, to a fragile, self-escalating regime that amplifies them.

Results show that firms tied to others with heterogeneous prior premium experience tend to pay less for their acquisitions and have better-performing acquisitions than those tied to others with homogeneous experience. Firms also pay lower premiums when their network partners (1) have completed deals of diverse sizes, (2) have unique information, and (3) are themselves of diverse sizes.

We also predict that, although non-binding contracts may not generate as much initial cooperation as binding contracts, they will generate personal rather than situational attributions for any cooperation that results and will therefore not interfere with trust development. Two experiments investigated the effects of the use and removal of binding and non-binding contracts. When binding contracts that were previously allowed were no longer allowed or no longer chosen, trust dropped significantly. In contrast, non-binding contracts led to considerable cooperation, and their removal reduced trust less than removing binding contracts. Behavioral and perceptual data suggest that non-binding contracts lead to personal attributions for cooperation and thus may provide an optimal basis for building interpersonal trust in a variety of situations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3094850","research article","ASQ","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of contracts and their impact on interpersonal trust without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We measured learning by a reduction in airline accident and incident rates, while controlling for other factors related to accidents and incidents. Our results show that heterogeneity is generally better for learning, as prior heterogeneity in the causes of errors decreases subsequent accident rates, producing a deeper, broader search for causality than simple explanations like \u201cblame the pilot.\u201d The benefits of heterogeneity, however, apply mainly to specialist airlines. Generalist airlines learn, instead, from outside factors such as the experience of others and general improvements in technology.

Using a 2 times 2 experimental design, with a trained confederate enacting mood conditions, the predicted effect of emotional contagion was found among group members, using both outside coders' ratings of participants' mood and participants' self-reported mood. No hypothesized differences in contagion effects due to the degree of pleasantness of the mood expressed and the energy level with which it was conveyed were found. There was a significant influence of emotional contagion on individual-level attitudes and group processes. As predicted, the positive emotional contagion group members experienced improved cooperation, decreased conflict, and increased perceived task performance.

With data from a sample of large and diversified firms, we examine the extent to which newly appointed CEOs' strategic orientation determines whether they use their power to maintain the status quo or refocus their firms' business portfolios. We assess CEOs' power with seven widely used indicators and use experience as heir apparent to the prior CEO as a measure of new CEOs' strategic orientation. Overall, results show that CEOs' power use is influenced by heir apparent experience in predicting the level of corporate strategic refocusing.

The empirical findings are assessed in the broader theoretical context of the IS success literature, including the Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Our results support DeLone and McLean's focus on integrated IS success models and their observation that IS success models need to be carefully specified in a given context. The Seddon model conceptually elaborates and clarifies aspects of the DeLone and McLean model, thereby effectively integrating core theoretical relationships espoused in the IS success literature.

It may be beneficial to some, but detrimental to other, organizational decisions. This study examines how computer-mediated communication (CMC) may be associated with group polarization. Two laboratory experiments were carried out. The first experiment, conducted in an identified setting, demonstrated that removal of verbal cues might not have reduced social presence sufficiently to impact group polarization, but removal of visual cues might have reduced social presence sufficiently to raise group polarization. Besides confirming the results of the first experiment, the second experiment showed that the provision of anonymity might also have reduced social presence sufficiently to raise group polarization. Analyses of process data from both experiments indicated that the reduction in social presence might have increased group polarization by causing people to generate more novel arguments and engage in more one-upmanship behavior. Collectively, process and outcome data from both experiments reveal how group polarization might be affected by level of social presence. Specifically, group discussion carried out in an unsupported setting or an identified face-to-face CMC setting tends to result in weaker group polarization. Conversely, group discussion conducted in an anonymous face-to-face CMC setting or a dispersed CMC setting (with or without anonymity) tends to lead to stronger group polarization. Implications of these results for further research and practice are provided.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.1.70.92","","ISR","Information Systems","3","['group polarization', 'social presence', 'anonymity']","The article discusses group polarization and its implications in communication settings, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) is rapidly becoming an important theoretical paradigm for comprehending the impacts of advanced information technologies (DeSanctis and Poole 1994). Intended as a complement to the faithfulness of appropriation scale developed by Chin et al. (1997), this research note describes the development of an instrument to capture the AST construct of consensus on appropriation. Consensus on appropriation (COA) is the extent to which group participants perceive that they have agreed on how to adopt and use a technology. While consensus on appropriation is an important component of AST, no scale is currently available to capture this construct. This research note develops a COA instrument in the context of electronic meeting systems use. Initial item development, statistical analyses, and validity assessment (convergent, discriminant, and nomological) are described here in detail. The contribution of this effort is twofold: First, a scale is provided for an important construct from AST. Second, this report serves as an example of rigorous scale development using structural equation modeling. Employing rigorous procedures in the development of instruments to capture AST constructs is critical if the sound theoretical base provided by AST is to be fully exploited in understanding phenomena related to the use of advanced information technologies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.1.91.93","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical development of a measurement scale related to Adaptive Structuration Theory without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In a recent study, Keeney (1999) proposed two sets of variables labeled as means objectives and fundamental objectives that influence Internet shopping. Means objectives, he argues, help businesses achieve what is important for their customers\u2014fundamental objectives. Based on Keeney's work, this paper describes the development of two instruments that together measure the factors that influence Internet commerce success. One instrument measures the means objectives that influence online purchase (e.g., Internet vendor trust) and the other measures the fundamental objectives that customers perceive to be important for Internet commerce (e.g., Internet product value). In phase one of the instrument development process, we generated 125 items for means and fundamental objectives. Using a sample of 199 responses by individuals with Internet shopping experience, these constructs were examined for reliability and validity. The Phase 1 results suggested a 4-factor, 21-item instrument to measure means objectives and a 4-factor, 17-item instrument to measure fundamental objectives. In Phase 2 of the instrument development process, we gathered a sample of 421 responses to further explore the 2 instruments. With minor modifications, the Phase 2 data support the 2 models. The Phase 2 results suggest a 5-factor, 21-item instrument that measures means objectives in terms of Internet product choice, online payment, Internet vendor trust, shopping travel, and Internet shipping errors. Results also suggest a 4-factor, 16-item instrument that measures fundamental objectives in terms of Internet shopping convenience, Internet ecology, Internet customer relation, and Internet product value. Evidence of reliability and discriminant, construct, and content validity is presented for the hypothesized measurement models.

Questions that likely require additional attention include: (1) Where/what is the real value in substituting information for physical processes?, (2) which NE systems effectively support end-to-end fulfillment?, and (3) when should a Net-enabled organization share information? With respect to extant studies in Net-enhancement, the field has been advanced in three methodological dimensions. Multiple methods have been used to validate measures. Approaches to metrics using archival/secondary data have also been initiated. Finally, strong external validity has been established through large scale data gathering.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.3.227.80","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of metrics in Net-enabled organizations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study proposes six dimensions of architectural metrics for Internet businesses: internal stability, external security, information gathering, order processing, system interface, and communication interface. The metrics are based on the three constructs that have been used to evaluate buildings in the real world. The structural construct indicates that Internet businesses need to be stable internally and secure externally. The functional construct implies that Internet businesses should provide convenient functions in the information-gathering and order-processing phases. Finally, the representational construct indicates that they need to provide a pleasant interface both to the systemand to those using it. For each of the six metrics, we have constructed questionnaires to measure the perceived level of architectural quality and identified feature lists that may be closely related to the perceived quality level. Large-scale empirical studies were conducted both to validate the proposed metrics and to explore their relevance across four Internet business domains. The validity of the metrics has been obtained in three ways. First, the content validity of the metrics was assured by pretests and pilot survey. Second, the results from the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the metrics had high convergent and discriminant validities. Finally, the reliability coefficients were found to be high enough to establish the reliability of the proposed metrics. The relevance of the metrics has been explored in two ways. Structural equation models were used to test the causal relations between the three constructs and user satisfaction, as well as customer loyalty, in four domains. Correlation analyses were used to explore the relations between the perceived architectural quality and objective design features in four domains. This paper ends with the implications and limitations of the study results.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.3.239.79","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical metrics for evaluating Internet businesses without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this paper, we develop and implement an approach for measuring the magnitudes of switching costs and brand loyalty for online service providers based on the random utility modeling framework. We then examine how systems usage, service design, and other firm and individual-level factors affect switching and retention. Using data on the online brokerage industry, we find significant variation (as much as a factor of two) in measured switching costs. We find that customer demographic characteristics have little effect on switching, but that systems usage measures and systems quality are associated with reduced switching. We also find that firm characteristics such as product line breadth and quality reduce switching and may also reduce customer attrition. Overall, we conclude that online brokerage firms appear to have different abilities in retaining customers and have considerable control over their switching costs.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.3.255.78","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of customer retention and switching costs in the online brokerage industry without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, which are key indicators of 'woke' themes."],["2002","13","3","Kevin ZhuKevin Zhukzhu@gsm.uci.eduGraduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3125Search for more papers by this author, Kenneth L.

The e-commerce capability metrics consist of four dimensions: information, transaction, customization, and supplier connection. These measures were empirically validated for reliability, content, and construct validity. Then we examined the nomological validity of these e-commerce metrics in terms of their relationships to firm performance, with data from 260 manufacturing companies divided into high IT-intensity and low IT-intensity sectors. Grounded in the dynamic capabilities perspective and the resource-based theory of the firm, a series of hypotheses were developed. After controlling for variations of industry effects and firm size, our empirical analysis found a significant relationship between e-commerce capability and some measures of firm performance (e.g., inventory turnover), indicating that the proposed metrics have demonstrated value for capturing e-commerce effects. However, our analysis showed that e-commerce tends to be associated with the increased cost of goods sold for traditional manufacturing companies, but there is an opposite relationship for technology companies. This result seems to highlight the role of resource complementarity for the business value of e-commerce\u2014traditional companies need enhanced alignment between e-commerce capability and their existing IT infrastructure to reap the benefits of e-commerce.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.3.275.82","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical metrics related to e-commerce capability and firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This change raises questions concerning customer satisfaction with the online purchasing process. Web shopping involves a number of phases, including the information phase, in which customers search for information regarding their intended purchases. The purpose of this paper is to develop theoretically justifiable constructs for measuring Web-customer satisfaction during the information phase. By synthesizing the expectation-disconfirmation paradigm with empirical theories in user satisfaction, we separate Web site quality into information quality (IQ) and system quality (SQ), and propose nine key constructs for Web-customer satisfaction. The measurements for these constructs are developed and tested in a two-phase study. In the first phase, the IQ and SQ dimensions are identified, and instruments for measuring them are developed and tested. In the second phase, using the salient dimensions of Web-IQ and Web-SQ as the basis for formulating first-order factors, we develop and empirically test instruments for measuring IQ and SQ-satisfaction. Moreover, this phase involves the design and test of second-order factors for measuring Web-customer expectations, disconfirmation, and perceived performance regarding IQ and SQ. The analysis of the measurement model indicates that the proposed metrics have a relatively high degree of validity and reliability. The results of the study provide reliable instruments for operationalizing the key constructs in the analysis of Web-customer satisfaction within the expectation-disconfirmation paradigm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.3.296.76","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of measuring web-customer satisfaction without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

This paper reports results of a study that measured consumer satisfaction with the EC channel through constructs prescribed by three established frameworks, namely the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA), and Service Quality (SERVQUAL). Subjects purchased similar products through conventional as well as EC channels and reported their experiences in a survey after each transaction. Using constructs from the three frameworks, a model was constructed and tested to examine the determinants of the EC channel satisfaction and preference using the survey data. Structural equation model analyses indicate that metrics tested through each model provide a statistically significant explanation of the variation in the EC consumers' satisfaction and channel preference. The study found that TAM components\u2014perceived ease of use and usefulness\u2014are important in forming consumer attitudes and satisfaction with the EC channel. Ease of use also was found to be a signi.cant determinant of satisfaction in TCA. The study found empirical support for the assurance dimension of SERVQUAL as determinant in EC channel satisfaction.

Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice\u2014behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs\u2014disposition to trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions\u2014which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity), as Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality.

Hence, it is important for the database administrator to have the ability to evaluate security for snoopers using linear models. In this study we provide a methodology based on Canonical Correlation Analysis that is both appropriate and adequate for evaluating security. The methodology can also be used to evaluate the security provided by different security mechanisms such as query restrictions and data perturbation.

Many educational institutions, both academic and corporate, have undertaken initiatives that leverage the myriad of available DL technologies. Despite their rapid growth in popularity, however, alternative technologies for DL are seldom systematically evaluated for learning efficacy. Considering the increasing range of information and communication technologies available for the development of DL environments, we believe it is paramount for studies to compare the relative learning outcomes of various technologies. In this research, we employed a quasi-experimental field study approach to investigate the relative learning effectiveness of two collaborative DL environments in the context of an executive development program. We also adopted a framework of hierarchical characteristics of group support system (GSS) technologies, outlined by DeSanctis and Gallupe (1987), as the basis for characterizing the two DL environments. One DL environment employed a simple e-mail and listserv capability while the other used a sophisticated GSS (herein referred to as Beta system). Interestingly, the learning outcome of the e-mail environment was higher than the learning outcome of the more sophisticated GSS environment. The post-hoc analysis of the electronic messages indicated that the students in groups using the e-mail system exchanged a higher percentage of messages related to the learning task. The Beta system users exchanged a higher level of technology sense-making messages. No significant difference was observed in the students' satisfaction with the learning process under the two DL environments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.13.4.404.72","","ISR","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical evaluation of distributed learning environments without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consistent with expectations, we find that managers voluntarily disclose balance sheets when current earnings are relatively less informative, or when future earnings are relatively more uncertain. Specifically, balance sheet disclosures are more likely among firms: (1) in high technology industries; (2) reporting losses; (3) with larger forecast errors; (4) engaging in mergers or acquisitions; (5) that are younger; and (6) with more volatile stock returns.

In contrast, mark-to-market accounting does not provide efficient aggregation of raw information to solve the stewardship problem. Mark-to-market accounting, though sensible from a valuation perspective, fails to provide desirable incentives because it relies on the anticipated, rather than the actual, performance of the manager.

Our primary finding is that studies using a balance sheet approach to test for earnings management are potentially contaminated by measurement error in accruals estimates. In particular, if the partitioning variable used to indicate the presence of earnings management is correlated with the occurrence of mergers and acquisitions or discontinued operations, tests are biased and researchers are likely to erroneously conclude that earnings management exists when there is none. Additional results show that the errors in balance sheet accruals estimation can confound returns regressions where discretionary and non-discretionary accruals are used as explanatory variables.

I find an increase in disclosure during the period of increased earnings. This increase is pervasive across all types of disclosure and tends to be bundled with earnings announcements. The market responds positively to this disclosure. Firms continue to disclose at a high level as they approach earnings declines. However, they shift to disclosures that focus on the positive short-term results and do not discuss the impending decreases.

We hypothesize that analysts will supplement firms\u2019 financial information by placing greater relative emphasis on their own private (or idiosyncratic) information when deriving their earnings forecasts for firms with significant intangible assets. Our evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. We find that the consensus in analysts\u2019 forecasts, measured as the correlation in analysts\u2019 forecast errors, is negatively associated with a firm\u2019s level of intangible assets. This result is robust to controlling for analyst uncertainty about a firm\u2019s future earnings, which we also find to be higher for firms with high levels of internally generated (and expensed) intangibles. Given that analyst uncertainty increases and analyst consensus decreases with the level of a firm\u2019s intangible assets, we also expect and find that the degree to which the mean forecast aggregates private information and is more accurate than an individual analyst\u2019s forecast increases with a firm\u2019s intangible assets. Finally, additional analysis reveals that lower levels of analyst consensus are associated with high-technology manufacturing companies, and that this association is explained by the relatively high R&D expenditures made by these firms. Overall, our results are consistent with financial analysts augmenting the financial reporting systems of firms with higher levels of intangible assets (in terms of contributing to more accurate earnings expectations), particularly R&D-driven high-tech manufacturers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00048","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of financial analysts' forecasts related to intangible assets without addressing any social justice, DEI, or ethical themes.

The valuation of Internet firms, however, departs from conventional wisdom, with earnings not being priced, and negative cash flows being priced perhaps because they are viewed as investments. This difference between the two classes of firms may be expected, given the age and unique nature of the Internet industry. Second, there are significant differences between the initial valuation of firms at the prospectus and IPO stage and their valuation by the stock market at the end of the first trading day. For non-Internet firms, the difference is largely ascribed to the relative offering size. For Internet firms, however, the differences are with respect to positive cash flows, sales growth, R&D, and high-risk warnings, in addition to the relative offering size.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00050","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of IPO valuations and financial variables without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors focus on whether the value drivers associated with these prices differ between internet and non-internet firms, and between the offer price and the day one ending price. They conclude that there are differences in the value drivers used to value Internet versus non-Internet firms, and further differences in the value drivers used to arrive at the offer price and the day one ending price. The review raises several concerns about these conclusions. One concern is that the reader confronts a challenge in trying to interpret the differences between the value drivers affecting the offer price and the day one ending price. The review discusses two factors for the reader to consider before interpreting these differences. The review also critiques the paper\u2019s avoidance of disaggregated financial statement information in the value driver analyses and details several research design concerns.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00051","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial analysis related to IPOs without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

Based on the observation that managers are extremely concerned about earnings-per-share dilution in equity related compensation, we predict and find that firms experiencing significant employee stock option (ESO) exercises shift resources away from real investments towards the repurchase of their own stocks. We further find weak evidence of a decline in subsequent firm performance (as measured by return on assets) for several years following the cut in discretionary investments as a result of stock option exercises, though this result is sensitive to the metric used to measure performance. Collectively, our findings indicate that ESO exercises potentially impose a real cost on the firm in terms of foregone investment opportunities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00052","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of employee stock options and their impact on firm performance without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

Results indicate that revenue announcements are highly associated with three-day market returns and provide information incremental to that contained in earnings announcements. The use of grossed-up and barter revenue is common for certain sectors of Internet firms, but not pervasive across sectors. Evidence suggests that the value relevance of revenue for firms reporting grossed-up and barter revenue declined subsequent to the \u201ccrash\u201d in April 2000. Additional analyses explore the effect of active individual investors on the pricing of revenue for firms reporting grossed-up and barter revenue.

Our objective is to examine relations between firms\u2019 corporate governance decisions and the informativeness of available measures of managerial performance. We consider financial measures such as earnings and stock return, as well as direct monitoring. We collect a sample of IPO firms from the manufacturing, Internet, and technology (non-Internet) industries, and examine how the use of various performance measures in annual compensation grants and turnover decisions varies with the information environment of the firm and with the extent of venture capital influence. Consistent with prior research that finds earnings are of limited usefulness in firm valuation for Internet firms, we find Internet firms place less importance on earnings and greater importance on stock returns in determining compensation grants than do non-Internet firms. We also find that compensation grants of firms with little or no venture capital influence display significantly stronger association with accounting and stock performance measures than those of firms with more intense monitoring by venture capitalists. This result is consistent with direct monitoring and the use of explicit performance measures acting as substitute governance mechanisms.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00058","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of corporate governance and performance measures without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

In the long window tests, we use factor analysis to group the counts of managerial actions taken by each firm over its post-IPO life into two broad managerial initiatives\u2014market penetration and organization building. These two initiatives explain a substantial portion of the cross-sectional variation in the firms\u2019 post-IPO life stock market returns beyond that explained by both reported earnings and analysts\u2019 forecasts of future earnings and revenues.

During a non-announcement period, we find that firms with relatively less predictable earnings have consistently higher total bid-ask spreads than firms with more predictable earnings. This finding suggests that firms with relatively less predictable earnings have a higher cost of equity capital than comparable firms with more predictable earning streams, ceteris paribus.

We investigate whether this finding also holds for the special items component of earnings. Given that special items are prominent in financial analysis and are assumed to have relatively straightforward implications for future earnings (special items are assumed to be largely transitory), one might expect that prices would fully impound the implications of special items for future earnings. Based on the \u201ctwo-equation\u201d approach used in Ball and Bartov [1996] and other studies (e.g., Abarbanell and Bernard [1992]; Sloan [1996]; Rangan and Sloan [1998]; and Soffer and Lys [1999]), we find that while prices reflect relatively more of the effects of special items compared to other earnings components, we still reject the null hypothesis that prices fully impound the implications of special items for future earnings. The \u201ctwo-equation\u201d approach assesses the consistency of coefficients in a pair of prediction and pricing equations, and thus depends on an assumed functional form. However, a less structured abnormal returns methodology like that used in Bernard and Thomas [1990] also supports the conclusion that the implications of special items are not fully impounded in prices. Specifically, a trading strategy based only on the sign of special items earns small but statistically significant abnormal returns during a 3-day window four quarters subsequent to the original announcement of special items.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00063","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In broad samples of actual and simulated CEO option portfolios, we show that these proxies capture more than 99% of the variation in option portfolio value and sensitivities.

We document that abnormal annual returns are significantly greater for firms meeting expectations, controlling for the information in the current year\u2019s earnings. We then test whether firms meeting expectations experience higher returns simply because their expected future earnings are also higher. We find firms meeting expectations have significantly higher earnings forecasts and realized earnings than firms that do not. We find that controlling for these higher future earnings, firms meeting expectations in one or two years do not receive a greater valuation than their fundamentals would suggest. We find, however, that the market assigns a higher value to firms that meet expectations consistently, controlling for an estimate of the firm\u2019s fundamental value.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00069","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on financial performance metrics and market behavior without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity or inclusion.

Reporting a larger earnings surprise reduces the inferred earnings precision, dampening the impact on firm value of reporting higher earnings, and providing a natural demand for smoother earnings.

We fail to find a similar difference for firms employing Big 6 versus non-Big 6 auditors.

Working within specialization, managers and seniors both contribute in a nonredundant way to the team\u2019s overall effectiveness.

An incumbent firm is privately informed about the market demand and its production cost after operating as a monopolist in the first period, and then competes against an entrant in the second period. Two main results are derived. First, it is shown that the incumbent is best off by pre-committing to disclose both the demand and cost information. By disclosing full information, the incumbent nullifies its self-defeating intertemporal incentives, which arise whenever it has private information about the market demand, its cost efficiency, or both. In addition, the equilibrium output variance is the largest under full disclosure, which benefits the incumbent ex ante. Second, the paper shows that the incumbent\u2019s full disclosure of the demand and cost information may or may not be desirable from a social efficiency standpoint. In particular, the correlation between the firms\u2019 production costs is crucial to the rank of disclosure policies in terms of their impact on social efficiency.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00076","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of disclosure policy in oligopoly markets without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We explore this question in two steps: First, we analytically examine the impact of market inefficiencies on the estimation of coefficients in value relevance regressions and derive a procedure that corrects potential biases caused by such inefficiencies. The procedure adjusts contemporaneous stock prices for future risk adjusted price changes, and yields value relevance coefficient estimates that capture both contemporaneous and delayed market reactions. Second, we apply this procedure to three types of studies that have attracted much attention in the accounting literature: 1) the value relevance of earnings and book values; 2) the value relevance of residual income value estimates; and 3) the value relevance of accruals and cash flows. We compare coefficient estimates obtained from conventional value relevance regressions with those from regressions employing our adjustment procedure, and find statistically significant differences in both level and return regression coefficient estimates. The magnitude of differences in coefficient estimates for return regressions is large enough to affect economic inferences. We find that coefficients of lagged price deflated residual income value estimates move significantly closer toward a predicted value of one implying a meaningful reduction of bias. Last, we find that cash flows now have significantly larger coefficient estimates than accruals consistent with their greater persistence.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.00078","original articles","JAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accounting and market efficiency without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or DEI themes.

Specifically, we investigate the productivity and quality impacts of eliminating direct labor variance reporting with panel data containing 36 months of data from seven experimental plants that eliminated direct labor variance reporting and 11 control plants that did not.

Closed\u2013end fund assets consist of unrestricted and restricted securities, and realized and unrealized income. While unrestricted securities are not subject to earnings management, restricted security values are largely discretionary. Managerial valuation of restricted securities is modeled as contingent on unrestricted returns relative to a performance benchmark. Four unrestricted performance regions are identified. Known multi\u2013period compensation incentives become the basis for hypothesizing earnings management behaviors in the regions in the form of restricted security valuation. Across several benchmarks, the results are consistent with multi\u2013period maximization rather than simpler single\u2013period compensation maximization or income smoothing. Funds with extreme unrestricted performance show relatively larger income\u2013decreasing earnings management, and funds with slightly\u2013below benchmark returns show relatively larger income\u2013increasing earnings management than those slightly above.

Because there are no market prices for ESOs, the traditional avenues for testing option\u2013pricing models are unavailable. This research relies instead on techniques from the economic forecasting literature, viewing model values as forecasts of the options\u2019 payoff. The theoretically appropriate rate at which to discount ESO payoffs is derived under the maintained hypothesis that the Black\u2013Scholes model is valid. This rate is used in estimating ex post ESO costs at the time of grant, which are then compared with Black\u2013Scholes estimates using Theil\u2019s [1966] tests of forecast rationality. Based on a sample of 966 ESO grants over 1963\u20131984, the results suggest that the Black\u2013Scholes model, adjusted for concavity in the time to exercise using the Hemmer, Matsunaga, and Shevlin [1994] procedure, appears to provide reasonable estimates of ex post ESO costs for the average ESO grant.

These disclosures are approximately 500% more accurate than the simple time\u2013series expected report dates used in prior accounting research. These disclosures are also informative. On average, managers who miss their own expected date eventually report earnings that fall about one penny per share below consensus forecasts for each day of delay.

Prior research on risky decision making indicates that decision makers are often risk averse when choosing among alternatives that yield potential gains, and risk taking when the alternatives yield losses. The results reported here indicate that negative or positive affective reactions can change this commonly found risky behavior. Managers were generally risk avoiding (taking) for gains (losses) in the absence of affective reactions, as predicted by prospect theory. However, when affect was present, they tended to reject investment alternatives that elicited negative affect and accept alternatives that elicited positive affect, resulting in risk taking (avoiding) in gain (loss) contexts. The results also indicate that affective reactions can influence managers to choose alternatives with lower economic value, suggesting that managers consider both financial data and affective reactions when evaluating the utility of a decision alternative. These findings point to the importance of considering affective reactions when attempting to understand and predict risky decision making in accounting contexts.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-679X.t01-1-00056","original articles","JAR","Accounting","2","['affective reactions', 'risk-taking', 'decision making']","The article primarily focuses on the psychological aspects of decision making in accounting without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We review 25 years of research in physiobehavior, arguing that it can be extended in a natural way to predict that consumers are more likely to switch between sensory attributes (e.g., flavor) than nonsensory attributes (e.g., brand). Specifically, we examine the work on sensory-specific satiety, a term used to describe the phenomenon whereby the pleasantness of a food just eaten drops significantly while the pleasantness of uneaten foods remains unchanged. These findings lead to the thesis explored in this research that consumers are more likely to seek variety on sensory attributes, which is then tested across three studies comparing flavor switching to brand switching. Study 1 uses ACNielsen wand panel data for purchases of tortilla chips and cake mixes from almost 2,000 consumers over a three-year period. Study 2 examines actual consumption behavior using a six-week consumption diary panel from over 850 consumers in two cities. Heterogeneity across the samples in terms of the observed effects is examined in both studies. Study 3 employs a survey methodology to ascertain whether the differential role of flavor-based versus brand-based variety seeking is mediated by factors other than sensory-specific satiety. The findings strongly support the relevance of sensory-specific satiety to attribute-level variety seeking. Across the three studies, consumers switched more intensively on flavor than brand in 14 of the 15 categories examined and other factors such as preference heterogeneity and perceived risk fail to explain this difference.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/1/105/1851151","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior related to sensory attributes and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Although it has often been assumed that repeated exposure leads to a direct affective response, more recent evidence suggests that prior exposure leads to processing fluency at the time of judgment. It is a misattribution about the source of this processing fluency that results in preference for the stimulus. To date, the majority of research on the processing fluency/attribution hypothesis has focused on when people will make fluency-based attributions, while assuming the amount of the processing fluency is a direct function of exposure. In this article, we propose that stimulus characteristics and presentation factors will interact with repetition to determine the amount of processing fluency associated with a stimulus at various levels of exposure.

Because the pursuit of differentness (or counterconformity motivation) varies across individuals to influence consumer responses, we develop and validate a trait measure of consumers' need for uniqueness. Consumers' need for uniqueness is defined as an individual's pursuit of differentness relative to others that is achieved through the acquisition, utilization, and disposition of consumer goods for the purpose of developing and enhancing one's personal and social identity. Following assessments of the scale's latent structure, a series of validation studies examines the scale's validity.

Star Trek's subculture of consumption is found to be constructed as a powerful utopian refuge. Stigma, social situation, and the need for legitimacy shape the diverse subcultures' consumption meanings and practices. Legitimizing articulations of Star Trek as a religion or myth underscore fans' heavy investment of self in the text. These sacralizing articulations are used to distance the text from its superficial status as a commercial product.

Our theoretical framework suggests that ambiguity in the context in which the initial choices are made determines the level of certainty in the initial preference. Certainty in the initial preference combines with uninformative additional experience to create a shift in the relevance of the attributes and biased information gathering in subsequent choices. These tendencies in turn lead to persistent preferences for the attributes of a previously chosen brand. In experiments 1A, 1B, and 1C, we varied the levels of ambiguity in the initial choice context and additional experience with a chosen brand and studied their effect on preference persistence. The findings offer support to the processes we propose. In experiment 2, we found that additional experience caused persistent preferences even for an irrelevant attribute as long as it was a differentiating attribute in the initial choice. Experiments 3 and 4 found that (a) the relative attractiveness of the chosen brand in the initial choice context and (b) a deliberation that compared the competing attributes in terms of their ability to render certain benefits attenuated the effects found in experiments 1A and 1B.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/1/89/1851193","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer preferences and decision-making processes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The first learning process is a relatively unfocused process in which all stimulus elements get cross-referenced for later retrieval. This process is backward looking and consistent with human associative memory (HAM) models. The second learning process requires that a benefit be the focus of prediction during learning. It assumes feature-benefit associations change only to the extent that the expected performance of the product does not match the experienced performance of the product. This process is forward looking and consistent with adaptive network models. The importance of this two-process theory is most apparent when a product has multiple features. During HAM learning, each feature-benefit association will develop independently. During adaptive learning, features will compete to predict benefits and, thus, feature-benefit associations will develop interdependently. We find adaptive learning of feature-benefit associations when consumers are motivated to learn to predict a benefit (e.g., because it is perceived to have hedonic relevance) but find HAM learning when consumers attend to an associate of lesser motivational significance.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/2/202/1899164","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer learning processes related to brand associations without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although each individual also has a private or inner self (chi), it is also subject to the collective will. This idea is in keeping with Confucian ideals that encourage the individual to focus on developing internal moral constraints and conquering selfishness in the pursuit of social propriety. Furthermore, the boundaries of the familial self are permeable and may include others, such as important romantic partners and, occasionally, close friends who become \u201clike family.\u201d In family and like-family contexts, reciprocity is discouraged, and there is no need to build relationships through gift giving.

Applying this notion to advertisements, this research examines picture-text congruity as a potential moderator of language effects in memory.

Study 1 shows that consumers perceive price-matching policies as signals of low store prices and that the presence of a refund increases the likelihood of discontinuing price search. Contrary to the predictions based on signaling theory in information economics, studies 2 and 3 show that when search costs are low, the number of stores searched increases in the presence versus absence of a price-matching policy. When search costs are high, consumers appear to accept the price-matching signal at face value and search less in the presence of a refund.

Even after spending most of his life in major urban areas, John never lost the slightly countrified tone to his voice or the singular gracefulness of his gentle manner.

On completing high school (1933), he worked for two years as a life insurance agent (a tough sell during the Great Depression) before attending the small two-year Blackburn College (the first in his family to pursue higher education) and then earning a B.S. in business (1939) and an M.S. in economic history (1941) at the University of Illinois (where he also successfully overcame a severe stuttering problem). After working briefly for the chamber of commerce and serving a stint in the Army's Ordnance Division during World War II (including a dangerous tour of duty at Okinawa), John took advantage of the GI Bill to pursue further graduate studies at Harvard, where he worked with Joseph Schumpeter and ultimately received his Ph.D. in economics (1952).

We examine the influence of four product context characteristics on happiness with a target product: pleasantness, sequence, domain match with target (i.e., whether products in the context set belong to the same category as the target), and context set size. When context and target match, pleasant and improving (compared to less pleasant and worsening) contexts induce less happiness with the target product. When there is domain mismatch, however, the results are reversed. Furthermore, the assimilation effects are significantly influenced by set size, but the contrast effects are not. While the contrast effects appear to occur by default and appear to be driven by a process of comparison, the assimilation effects appear to be driven by mood. These effects hold even when perception of domain match is manipulated via instructional framing.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/3/355/1830046","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product evaluation without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Consumers' success perceptions are, in turn, determined by their expectations of overall participation and efficacy, as well as the message frame inherent in proboycott communications. Two key determinants of consumers' boycotting costs are their preference for the boycotted product and their access to its substitutes. More specifically, consumers who are more susceptible to the normative influence exerted by the reference group of potential boycotters are more influenced by expected overall participation rates in their boycott likelihood.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/3/399/1830054","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['boycott', 'social-issue', 'normative influence', 'participation']","The article discusses consumer boycotts, particularly in relation to social issues, indicating a moderate focus on social justice themes.

Task Sensitivity in Information Source SelectionGet access","Ironically, when consumers turn to an information source to assist in decision making, they are faced with the added responsibility of having to make a decision about the information source itself. A normative model is presented that shows that consumer assessment of an information source should include both the task for which an information source is sought and the appropriate probability of success for the task. A key distinction between tasks is whether or not the consumer knows the agents' (or prospective agents') ratings of the alternative in question at the time of his or her assessment of the information source. A series of experiments is presented that examines consumer assessment of the diagnosticity of one type of information source, consumer agents (e.g., movie critics and stock analysts) across the three common tasks of seeking recommendations, seeking evaluations, and choosing between agents who have provided conflicting advice. Results show that consumers frequently select inferior agents for providing recommendations and choose product alternatives that should be avoided because of a failure to recognize when a task calls for a conditional rather than overall assessment of agent prior performance. A final study attempts to isolate the reasons for these shortcomings by examining the process underlying consumer diagnosticity assessment of information sources. Implications and future research to address and improve consumer assessment of information sources across tasks are discussed.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/3/418/1830063","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['consumer assessment', 'information source', 'decision making']","The article discusses consumer decision-making processes and the assessment of information sources, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We propose that perceived risk is an important situational factor that moderates the impact of congruity on evaluations. Three studies show that the positive evaluation of moderately incongruent products, relative to congruent ones, does not appear when there is risk associated with product selection. When consumers perceive high risk associated with a purchase, the moderate incongruity effect is reversed such that the congruent is preferred to the moderately incongruent product. Only in conditions where subjects perceived no real risk did the positive effect of moderate incongruity appear. The limiting effect of perceived risk appears to be due to consumers' \u201cpreferences for the norm\u201d under high-risk conditions.

For example, recently introduced attributes such as GPS in cars or I-Link in computers are likely to have been novel to many consumers. Past research suggests that the addition of novel attributes is likely to improve product evaluation and sales, since consumers interpret these attributes as additional benefits provided by the manufacturer. However, this article demonstrates that the positive effect of novel attributes holds only in the case of low-complexity products. In the case of high-complexity products, the addition of novel attributes can actually reduce product evaluation because of negative learning-cost inferences about these attributes. Further, the positive and negative effects of novel attributes on product evaluation are accentuated by external search for information when the information discovered through search is ambiguous in nature. Finally, it is shown that the negative effect of novel attributes on the evaluation of high-complexity products can persist even after consumers are given explicit information about the benefits of novel attributes. A key marketing implication of these findings is that novel attributes may contribute to technophobia, or consumer resistance toward technological innovation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/3/462/1830079","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of product evaluation related to novel attributes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Further, our results show that the more familiar consumers are with an embarrassing product purchase, the less embarrassed they are likely to feel.

A series of three experiments investigates implications of these processing differences within a single language, Korean, where words can be written in the alphabetic Hangul or in the logographic Hancha. These experiments examine contextual interference from auditory and visual stimuli, relational memory between brand names and auditory and visual brand identifiers, and two qualitative processing outcomes, serial-order memory and spatial-relational memory.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/3/482/1830091","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on cognitive processing differences between alphabetic and logographic scripts without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Overall, the data suggest that FLAG choice entails an embodied, holistic experience of perfect fit arising during a consumer's in situ encounter with an object of choice.

In this article, we show that the self-positivity bias hinders message processing, and we demonstrate that message cues can reduce this bias and engage people in more precautionary thinking and behavior. We identify the process by which risk-behavior cues provided in the message affect people's estimates of their vulnerability (self-risk estimates), depth of message processing, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. We test and find support for our theory in three studies that specify the types of risk behaviors that make the contraction of a disease seem easy versus difficult (study 1), that examine their interactive effects with the number of risk behaviors that are enumerated (study 2), and that delineate the underlying process by which these effects manifest (study 3). We demonstrate that the self-positivity bias acts as an a priori hypothesis on the basis of which people process and test incoming risk-behavior information, as would be predicted by confirmatory hypothesis testing theory. Our findings affect the theoretical understanding of how memory- and message-based factors work in opposing ways and suggest a more comprehensive framework for understanding memory- versus message-based judgments. Our results also have implications for media strategy and public health policy by differentiating between commonly used risk-behavior messages that are beneficial to the communicator's goals (e.g., increase compliance) and those that are detrimental to the communicator's goals (e.g., decrease compliance).","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/4/533/1785468","articles","JCR","Marketing","3","['health', 'risk', 'behavior', 'public health']","The article discusses health-related information and public health policy, which touches on ethical considerations in marketing.

Drawing from a range of cultural and postmodern theories, we argue that the Rokeachian view is not sufficiently attuned to the meaning-based aspects of consumer value systems. Furthermore, it largely ignores the intracultural diversity among consumer value systems that arises from the fragmentation of postmodern consumer culture into diverse consumption microcultures. Our analysis focuses on the narratives that natural health consumers use to articulate the values manifest in their wellness-oriented consumption outlooks and practices. These narratives reveal the meaning-based linkages between these articulated values and the consumption goals being pursued through natural health practices. We further contextualize the natural health value system by highlighting four higher-order postmodern orientations that are inflected in this microculture. We discuss the implications of our analysis for conceptualizations of the fragmented postmodern marketplace, means-end analyses of consumer values, and generative theories of consumer goal formation.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/4/550/1785475","articles","JCR","Marketing","5","['diversity', 'microcultures', 'postmodern', 'values', 'wellness']","The article discusses the diversity of consumer value systems within the context of postmodern fragmentation, emphasizing the narratives and values of natural health consumers.

We extend previous research in two ways by focusing on the incongruity differences that exist between schemes and tropes. Study 1 uses syndicated data (Starch readership scores) to test how figures combine to affect the extent of processing. Results show that when figures leverage unique mechanisms (i.e., schemes and tropes), their combination yields incremental processing gains. Alternatively, when figures leverage redundant mechanisms (e.g., multiple tropes), their combination yields no incremental processing.

Results from two studies demonstrate that providing criteria to evaluate the sound quality of competing brands of stereos facilitates the encoding, retrieval, and alignment of the sensory attribute in a brand choice task. Study 1 shows that without criteria to evaluate sound quality during trial, memory for this attribute is poor. Further, perceptions of sound quality assimilate to conflicting market information, which adversely affects decision performance. The reverse is true when evaluative criteria and a scheme to rate the criteria are provided: memory for sound quality improves, perceptions of sound quality contrast with conflicting market information, more weight is placed on sound quality when decision making, and better choices are made. Study 2 shows that providing evaluative criteria during product trial enhances performance through improvement in the encoding process.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/4/603/1785504","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of consumer behavior and decision-making related to sensory attributes in marketing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Although one would expect irrelevant information to have little impact on predictions of product performance, we present evidence that the irrelevant information systematically weakens consumers' beliefs that the product will provide the benefit. We show that this dilution effect persists after subjects have acknowledged the irrelevance of the additional information but that it does depend on whether the product information is processed with the desired benefit in mind. We conclude that consumers are selectively looking for information that suggests the product will deliver the desired benefit and that they categorize any additional evidence, be it irrelevant or disconfirming, as not confirming. As a consequence, irrelevant information weakens consumers' beliefs in the product's ability to deliver the benefit.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/4/618/1785512","articles","JCR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer behavior and product performance without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Appraisals, in turn, influence self-definition. Kleine, Kleine, and Kernan (1993, study 2) empirically supported Solomon's hypothesis. Appraisals were found to completely mediate the relationship between possessions and self-definition. Appraisals are thus an essential link between possession sets and individuals' self-definitions. The current study extends the Kleine et al. (1993) model in two important ways. First, we combined insights from identity theory, appraisal theory, and the sociology of emotions literatures to offer a more precise and comprehensive conceptualization of the appraisal process that includes both cognitive and emotional components. The conceptualization distinguishes appraisals of possessions from appraisals of performance and reflected versus self-appraisals. Second, symbolic interactionist theory suggests that social interactions and media are social communication discourses that, like possessions, influence self-definitions via appraisals. The extended model incorporates these possibilities. Data collected from individuals with an identity based on one of two freely chosen athletic activities provides encouraging support for the extended model. The result pattern provides insights into how appraisals mediate the relationship between social communication discourses and self-definition.","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/28/4/659/1785548","re-inquiries","JCR","Marketing","4","['social identity', 'self-definition', 'appraisal process', 'social interactions']","The article discusses concepts related to social identity and self-definition, which can be linked to broader themes of diversity and inclusion.

We argue that since banks often lend via commitments, their lending and deposit-taking may be two manifestations of one primitive function: the provision of liquidity on demand. There will be synergies between the two activities to the extent that both require banks to hold large balances of liquid assets: If deposit withdrawals and commitment takedowns are imperfectly correlated, the two activities can share the costs of the liquid-asset stockpile.

Because pricing affects profitability, a firm's pass-through and exposure should be related.

The VAR yields three main results. First, firm-level stock returns are mainly driven by cash-flow news. For a typical stock, the variance of cash-flow news is more than twice that of expected-return news. Second, shocks to expected returns and cash flows are positively correlated for a typical small stock. Third, expected-return-news series are highly correlated across firms, while cash-flow news can largely be diversified away in aggregate portfolios.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00421","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical financial analysis and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

I find that inmarket mergers benefit borrowers if these mergers involve the acquisition of banks with small market shares. Interest rates charged by the consolidated banks decrease, but as the local market share of the acquired bank increases, the efficiency effect is offset by market power.

Thus risk compensation cannot vary independently of interest rate volatility. I also describe a broader class of models.

Evidence from Directors' and Officers' Insurance Purchases","We analyze a sample of 72 IPO firms that went public between 1992 and 1996 for which we have detailed proprietary information about the amount and cost of D&O liability insurance. If managers of IPO firms are exploiting superior inside information, we hypothesize that the amount of insurance coverage chosen will be related to the post-offering performance of the issuing firm's shares. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find a significant negative relation between the three-year post-IPO stock price performance and the insurance coverage purchased in conjunction with the IPO. One plausible interpretation is that, like insider securities transactions, D&O insurance decisions reveal opportunistic behavior by managers. This provides some motivation to argue that disclosure of the details of D&O insurance decisions, as is required in some other countries, is valuable.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00436","articles","JF","Finance","2","['opportunism', 'insurance', 'disclosure']","The article primarily focuses on financial performance and managerial behavior without significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

The combined market reaction to acquisition announcements is positive but acquiring firm excess values decline after the diversifying event. Much of the excess value reduction occurs because our sample firms acquire already discounted business units, and not because diversifying destroys value. This implies that the standard assumption that conglomerate divisions can be benchmarked to typical stand-alone firms should be carefully reconsidered. We also show that excess value does not decline when firms increase their number of business segments because of pure reporting changes.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00439","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis regarding corporate diversification and market reactions, with no mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2002","57","2","Vojislav Maksimovic,\u00a0\n                     Vojislav MaksimovicSearch for more papers by this authorGordon Phillips,\u00a0\n                     Gordon PhillipsRobert H.

Theory and Evidence","We develop a profit-maximizing neoclassical model of optimal firm size and growth across different industries based on differences in industry fundamentals and firm productivity. In the model, a conglomerate discount is consistent with profit maximization. The model predicts how conglomerate firms will allocate resources across divisions over the business cycle and how their responses to industry shocks will differ from those of single-segment firms. Using plant level data, we find that growth and investment of conglomerate and single-segment firms is related to fundamental industry factors and individual segment level productivity.

Although the model allows contagion through several channels, our focus is on contagion through cross-market rebalancing. Through this channel, investors transmit idiosyncratic shocks from one market to others by adjusting their portfolios' exposures to shared macroeconomic risks. The pattern and severity of financial contagion depends on markets' sensitivities to shared macroeconomic risk factors, and on the amount of information asymmetry in each market.

Continuation of short-term returns or momentum is one such pattern that has defied any rational explanation and is at odds with market efficiency.

Further, more companies tend to go public following periods of high initial returns. However, we find that the level of average initial returns at the time of filing contains no information about that company's eventual underpricing. Both the cycles in initial returns and the lead-lag relation between initial returns and IPO volume are predominantly driven by information learned during the registration period. More positive information results in higher initial returns and more companies filing IPOs soon thereafter.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00458","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of IPO market behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, reflecting a purely profit-focused analysis."],["2002","57","3","Michael J.

The investor's optimal investment strategy and indirect utility are given in simple closed form. Hedge demands depend on the investor's horizon and risk aversion and on the maturities of the bonds included in the portfolio. When short positions are precluded, the optimal strategy consists of investments in cash, equity, and a single nominal bond with optimally chosen maturity.

An analysis of the most active Nasdaq stocks shows that ECNs not only post informative quotes, but also, compared to market makers, ECNs post quotes rapidly and are more often at the inside. Additionally, ECN quoted spreads are smaller than dealer quoted spreads.

Although large, established firms have generally not cut their dividends, they also show a higher propensity to pay out cash through repurchases.

We term this empirical feature unspanned stochastic volatility (USV). While USV can be captured within an HJM framework, we demonstrate that bivariate models cannot exhibit USV. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for trivariate Markov affine systems to exhibit USV. For such USV models, bonds alone may not be sufficient to identify all parameters.

Firms choose to diversify. We use three alternative econometric techniques to control for the endogeneity of the diversification decision, and find evidence supporting the selfselection of diversifying firms. We find a strong negative correlation between a firms choice to diversify and firm value. The diversification discount always drops, and sometimes turns into a premium. There also exists evidence of selfselection by refocusing firms. These results point to the importance of explicitly modeling the endogeneity of the diversification status in analyzing its effect on firm value.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00476","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical econometric analysis of diversification in firms without any mention of social justice, ethics, or DEI themes.

Some of these studies imply that investors are too optimistic about (glamour) stocks that have had good performance in the recent past and too pessimistic about (value) stocks that have performed poorly. We examine whether investors systematically overestimate (underestimate) the future earnings performance of glamour (value) stocks over the 1976 to 1997 period. Our results fail to support the extrapolation hypothesis that posits that the superior performance of value stocks is because investors make systematic errors in predicting future growth in earnings of out-of-favor stocks.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00491","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of stock performance and investor behavior without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We show in a rational expectation example how private information affects equilibrium asset returns. Using a market microstructure model, we derive a measure of the probability of information-based trading, and we estimate this measure using data for individual NYSE-listed stocks for 1983 to 1998. We then incorporate our estimates into a Fama and French (1992) asset-pricing framework. Our main result is that information does affect asset prices. A difference of 10 percentage points in the probability of information-based trading between two stocks leads to a difference in their expected returns of 2.5 percent per year.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00493","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset returns and information-based trading without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Despite size differences in sample stocks, there is a surprising consistency to their trading. One dealer tends to dominate trading in a stock. Markets are concentrated and spreads are increasing in the volume and market share of the dominant dealer. Entry and exit are ubiquitous. Exiting dealers are those with very low profits and trading volume. Entering market makers fail to capture a meaningful share of trading or profits. Thus, free entry does little to improve the competitive nature of the market as entering dealers have little impact. We find, however, that for small stocks, the Nasdaq dealer market is being more competitive than the specialist market.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00496","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of dealer markets and trading dynamics without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Among firms with the highest distress risk as proxied by Ohlson's (1980) O-score, the difference in returns between high and low book-to market securities is more than twice as large as that in other firms. This large return differential cannot be explained by the three-factor model or by differences in economic fundamentals. Consistent with mispricing arguments, firms with high distress risk exhibit the largest return reversals around earnings announcements, and the book-to-market effect is largest in small firms with low analyst coverage.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00497","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and does not address any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

Dynamically, however, firms that diversify experience a net reduction in productivity. While the acquired plants increase productivity, incumbent plants suffer. Moreover, stock prices track firm productivity and this tracking is equally strong for diversified and stand-alone firms. Therefore, lower transparency of conglomerates is unlikely to explain the discrepancy between productivity and stock prices on average. Finally, I offer some evidence that this discrepancy may arise because conglomerates dissipate rents in the form of higher wages.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00500","articles","JF","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on productivity and financial metrics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that when a chaebol-affiliated firm makes an acquisition, its stock price on average falls. While minority shareholders of a chaebol-affiliated firm making an acquisition lose, the controlling shareholder of that firm on average benefits because the acquisition enhances the value of other firms in the group. This evidence is consistent with the tunneling hypothesis.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6261.00510","articles","JF","Finance","2","['minority shareholders', 'controlling shareholder', 'tunneling']","The article primarily focuses on financial outcomes of mergers within Korean business groups, with minimal emphasis on social justice or ethical considerations.

Key to this matching are parameterizations of the market prices of risk that let the risk factors affect the market prices of risk directly, and not only through factor volatilities.

We argue that differences in information flows and consequences across national institutional environments affect the perceived uncertainty of decision situations. For this reason, the institutional environment in which managers reside should play a fundamental and systematic role in influencing their perceptions of risk. We test our model on managers from two environments that contrast in terms of information and consequences related to risk, a free-market economy (the U.S.) and a centrally planned economy (the Czech Republic in 1992).

The proposed framework (1) uses a multidimensional conceptualization for the trustworthiness construct; (2) incorporates two distinct facets of consumer trust, namely, frontline employees and management policies and practices; and (3) specifies value as a key mediator of the trust\u2013loyalty relationship. The authors test the proposed model using data from two service contexts\u2014retail clothing (N = 264) and nonbusiness airline travel (N = 113). The results support a tripartite view of trustworthiness evaluations along operational competence, operational benevolence, and problem-solving orientation dimensions. Moreover, the authors find evidence of contingent asymmetric relationships between trustworthiness dimensions and consumer trust. For frontline employees, benevolent behaviors demonstrate a dominant \u201cnegativity\u201d effect (i.e., a unit negative performance has a stronger effect than a unit positive performance), whereas problem-solving orientation has a dominant \u201cpositivity\u201d effect (i.e., a unit positive performance has a stronger effect than a unit negative performance). Value completely mediates the effect of frontline employee trust on loyalty in the retailing context and partially mediates the effect of management policies and practices trust on loyalty in the airlines context. The role of frontline employees is more critical in the retailing context, whereas management practices and policies play the dominant role in the airlines context. Overall, the proposed framework successfully models trust and loyalty mechanisms across the two industries examined in the study, while remaining sensitive to essential contextual differences.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.66.1.15.18449","research article","JM","Marketing","3","['trustworthiness', 'management policies', 'frontline employees']","The article discusses trust and loyalty in consumer relationships, incorporating management practices and employee behaviors, which hints at ethical considerations.

The authors conduct a laboratory experiment to consider how ingredient branding affects consumer acceptance of a novel line extension (or one that has not been introduced before) as well as the ability of the brand to leverage that ingredient to introduce future category extensions. The authors study two particular types of novel line extensions or brand expansions: (1) slot-filler expansions, in which the level of one existing product attribute changes (e.g., a scent in Tide detergent that is new to the laundry detergent category) and (2) new attribute expansions, in which an entirely new attribute or characteristic is added to the product (e.g., cough relief liquid added to Life Savers candy). The authors examine two types of ingredient branding strategies by branding the target attribute ingredient for the brand expansion with either a new name as a self-branded ingredient (e.g., Tide with its own EverFresh scented bath soap) or an established, well-respected name as a cobranded ingredient (e.g., Tide with Irish Spring scented bath soap). The results indicate that with slot-filler expansions, a cobranded ingredient facilitates initial expansion acceptance, but a self-branded ingredient leads to more favorable subsequent category extension evaluations. With more dissimilar new attribute expansions, however, a cobranded ingredient leads to more favorable evaluations of both the initial expansion and the subsequent category extension.

In the advertising budgeting context, marketing scholars report that firms possessing high levels of cash tend to spend more on advertising than what seems necessary or desirable. Indeed, this positive link between excess cash and advertising expenditures constitutes a part of what is commonly referred to as the affordability method of advertising budgeting. Surprisingly, there has been little research that attempts to view this association as a manifestation of agency costs. Therefore, in this article, the authors examine whether agency costs, as measured by managerial ownership, moderate the relationship between excess cash and advertising expenditures. On the basis of received theory, the authors conceptualize that agency costs will first decrease, then increase, and then decrease again with the level of managerial ownership. Accordingly, the authors hypothesize and find that the fraction of incremental earnings reinvested in advertising follows the same pattern in managerial ownership.

This newly identified pattern, which the authors call a \u201csaddle,\u201d is explained by the dual-market phenomenon that differentiates between early market adopters and main market adopters as two separate markets. If these two segments\u2014the early market and the main market\u2014adopt at different rates, and if this difference is pronounced, then the overall sales to the two markets will exhibit a temporary decline at the intermediate stage. The authors employ both empirical analysis and cellular automata, an individual-level, complex system modeling technique for generating and analyzing data, to investigate the conditions under which a saddle occurs. The model highlights the importance of cross-market communication in determining the existence of a saddle. At low levels of this parameter, more than 50% of the cases of new product growth involved a saddle. This percentage gradually decreased as the parameter increased, and at values close to the within-market parameters, the proportion of saddle occurrences dropped below 5%.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.66.2.1.18472","research article","JM","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical analysis of sales patterns in the consumer electronics industry without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Like all market discontinuities, the Internet creates opportunities as well as threats\u2014it can be performance-enhancing as readily as it can be performance-destroying. Making use of event-study methodology, the authors assess the net impact of adding an Internet channel on a firm's stock market return, a measure of the change in expected future cash flows. The authors find that, on average, Internet channel investments are positive net-present-value investments. The authors then identify firm, introduction strategy, and marketplace characteristics that influence the direction and magnitude of the stock market reaction. The results indicate that powerful firms with a few direct channels are expected to achieve greater gains in financial performance than are less powerful firms with a broader direct channel offering. In terms of order of entry, early followers have a competitive advantage over both innovators and later followers, even when time of entry is controlled for.

However, one potentially valuable source of brand equity\u2014the operation of intergenerational influences\u2014has generally been overlooked in the marketing literature. This article reports the findings of two studies that show intergenerational impacts on brand equity to be persistent and powerful across an array of consumer packaged goods. However, as a strategic challenge, these effects seem to apply strongly for some brands but not for others\u2014they are selective. In Study 1, the authors use parallel surveys of mother\u2013daughter dyads to isolate and quantify intergenerational impacts, and the surveys reveal a differential range of effects at both the product category and the brand level. In Study 2, the authors use interpretivist methods to delve more deeply into these effects\u2014the forms they take, the way they have developed, and factors that sustain or disrupt them. On the basis of these findings, the authors identify implications for managers and future research needs.

The coalition of disparate corporate cultures yields appreciable levels of role stress for people in boundary-spanning positions. Dedicated assets and communication modality are factors that influence the level of role ambiguity and conflict. The authors implicate these facets of role stress as antecedents to four forms of effectiveness drawn from the competing values framework. The authors present alternative perspectives that examine the relationship between stress and performance. The received view frames role stressors as linear, negative antecedents to organizational outcomes. The authors contrast this perspective with theories that espouse triphasic, parabolic, and interactive influences of stressors on organizational outcomes. Data gathered with 218 managers of dual-branded retail oil outlets indicate that the relevance of these alternative perspectives is mitigated by the form of effectiveness pursued by the organization. The results support a linear relationship between role conflict and bargaining efforts, yet they also offer evidence of nonlinear influences of role ambiguity on contributions to sales, customer satisfaction, and competence.

In this article, the authors present the results of two studies that examine what business-to-business customers value in their relationships with key contact employees, what customers' concerns are when a favored key contact employee is no longer available to serve them, and what vendor firms can do to alleviate these concerns and to retain employee knowledge even if they cannot retain the employee in that position.

Using survey data from senior managers in business-to-business firms, the authors study the adoption of e-business, a radical technology with the potential to alter business models. The authors first establish the distinctiveness of technological opportunism from related constructs, such as organizational innovativeness, and show that it offers a significantly better explanation of technology adoption than existing constructs do. In a follow-up survey of senior managers, the authors investigate the antecedents of technological opportunism and find that organizations can develop technological opportunism by taking specific actions such as focusing on the future, by having top management advocate new technologies, and by becoming more of an adhocracy culture and less of a hierarchy culture. The proposed technological opportunism construct can inform theory development on the relative emphasis on internal (research and development) versus external (buying, licensing) development of technologies and the complementarities in technology orientation and market orientation in the firm. The results can be used by managers who seek to develop the technological opportunism capability of their firms and by those in technology vendor firms who seek to develop segmentation strategies based on the technological opportunism capabilities of their customer firms.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.66.3.47.18508","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['technology', 'adoption', 'business models']","The article primarily focuses on technological opportunism and its impact on business models without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Yet there is little empirical evidence of a positive impact of trust on performance. Indeed, scholars suggest that the sources of trust may provide opportunities for its abuse. Following this line of thinking, the authors investigate the dual roles of sales controls and supervisor behaviors as antecedents of salespeople's belief in the benevolence of the supervisor (i.e., supervisee trust). The authors then examine these antecedents as moderators of the relationship between supervisee trust and sales performance in the context of selling new products. Data on field salespeople from high-technology firms in China and the United States suggest that factors such as supervisor accessibility engender supervisee trust but do not necessarily enhance its impact on sales performance. In the Chinese sample, supervisee trust enhances sales performance when output control is adopted, when the supervisor has a higher level of achievement orientation style, and when the salesperson has higher role ambiguity. Furthermore, the results suggest that the supervisee trust\u2013sales performance relationship is negative when supervisor accessibility is high. With the exception of achievement orientation and supervisor accessibility, these effects are negative or nonexistent in the U.S. sample.

The findings suggest that though satisfactory recoveries can produce a \u201crecovery paradox\u201d after one failure, they do not trigger such paradoxical increases after two failures. Furthermore, \u201cdouble deviations\u201d can occur following two consecutive unsatisfactory recoveries or following an unsatisfactory recovery in response to a second failure. The findings indicate that customers reporting an unsatisfactory recovery followed by a satisfactory recovery reported significantly higher ratings at the second postrecovery period than did customers reporting the opposite recovery sequence. The outcome of the second recovery also demonstrated a significant influence on customer ratings (positively if the recovery was satisfactory, negatively if the recovery was unsatisfactory), regardless of whether the customer found the first recovery satisfactory or unsatisfactory. In addition, although the increased change in recovery expectations and failure severity ratings from the first failure to the second is more dramatic for customers who previously reported a satisfactory recovery, the increase in attributions of blame toward the firm is more pronounced for customers who previously reported an unsatisfactory recovery.

There is, however, little evidence for the effectiveness of attempting both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously, and some of what little empirical and theoretical literature is available suggests that emphasizing both simultaneously may not work. In a study of managers in firms seeking to obtain a financial return from quality improvements, the authors address the issue of which quality profitability emphasis (revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both) is most effective. The authors examine firm performance using managers' reports of firm performance and longitudinal secondary data on firm profitability and stock returns. Although it is clear that no company can neglect either revenue expansion or cost reduction, the empirical results suggest that firms that adopt primarily a revenue expansion emphasis perform better than firms that try to emphasize cost reduction and better than firms that try to emphasize both revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously.

In this study, the authors show that these price-knowledge surveys provide imperfect estimates of price knowledge, because they focus only on recall and short-term memory. The authors propose, instead, to use a combination of price recall, price recognition, and deal recognition to measure the degree to which consumers use auditory verbal, visual Arabic, or analogue magnitude representations to memorize prices. The authors show how the combination of these three measures provides a much richer understanding of consumers' knowledge of prices. The results suggest that the price knowledge involved in reference prices may often not be accessible to recall but shows up in price recognition and deal recognition.

Despite its importance, this topic has received relatively little research attention. Unlike previous research, this study adopts a more comprehensive perspective on retail services by examining three important research gaps related to a service-oriented business strategy: First, the authors elaborate on the dimensions of a service-oriented business strategy and introduce a new measure of this strategy. Second, the authors examine the antecedents of a service-oriented business strategy. In practice, there appears to be considerable variability in terms of the extent to which retailers demonstrate a service orientation, but there is a major gap in the understanding of what factors influence this orientation. Third, the authors investigate the neglected link between a service-oriented business strategy and performance outcomes. To examine these three important areas, the authors conducted an empirical study of clothing and furniture retailers in both the United States and Germany. This study provides evidence for the proposed conceptualization of a service-oriented business strategy. The authors also find that the investigated antecedents account for some variance of a service-oriented business strategy, which in turn positively affects company performance in the market and thereby profitability. Furthermore, the authors discuss several important research issues as well as managerial implications and future research avenues.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.66.4.86.18511","research article","JM","Marketing","2","['service orientation', 'performance outcomes', 'retailers']","The article focuses primarily on business strategy and performance outcomes without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

To obtain these predictions, the authors propose a model for market similarity that incorporates the structure of the U.S. retailing industry and the geographic location of markets. The model makes use of the idea that if two markets have the same retailers or are located close to each other, then branded goods in these markets should have similar sales performance (other factors being held constant). In holdout samples, the proposed spatial prediction method improves greatly on naive predictors such as global-market averages, nearest neighbor predictors, or local averages. In addition, the authors show that the spatial model gives more plausible estimates of price elasticities. It does so for two reasons. First, the spatial model helps solve an omitted variables problem by allowing for unobserved factors with a cross-market structure. An example of such unobserved factors is the shelf-space allocations made at the retail-chain level. Second, the model deals with uninformative estimates of price elasticities by drawing them toward their local averages.

The main conclusion is that the pioneer's temporary monopoly over the early followers plus its first-mover advantages typically offset the survival risks associated with market and technological uncertainties. These results are consistent with previous research in the sense that first-mover advantages that increase a pioneer's market share also help protect the pioneer from outright failure.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.1.120.18938","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market entry strategies and survival rates of businesses without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The proattitudinal information accessible from memory is then aligned with information contained in the challenge in order to assess the diagnosticity of the challenge, that is, how much it \u201cdamages\u201d the retrieved brand information. If the challenge is not perceived to be diagnostic, the retrieved brand information is used to defend the previous attitudinal position. If the challenge is perceived to be diagnostic, judgments are revised in direct proportion to the amount of damage identified in the alignment phase. Four experiments test the model's predictions about the influence of abstract versus attribute-specific brand positioning on judgment revision. Consistent with the model's predictions, results show that compared with attribute-specific positioning, abstract positioning will result in less judgment revision when the challenge is specific (e.g., a direct attack about particular attributes of the brand) and the initial brand evaluation is based on limited learning of the positioning information. When the challenge is general (e.g., a blanket, unspecific negative statement about the brand), abstract positioning will result in greater judgment revision than attribute-specific positioning will. The differential effectiveness of abstract versus attribute-specific positioning is mediated by (1) the accessibility in memory of the positioning information at the time of the challenge and (2) the perceived diagnosticity of the challenge after alignment with the retrieved brand information.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.1.18.18929","research article","JMR","Marketing","2","[]","The article primarily focuses on a technical model of judgment revision related to brand positioning without any evident emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In many cases, it is reasonable to expect that the choice of a particular alternative may be influenced by non\u2013product-related attributes. For example, latent attitudes and perceptions may play as much of a role in shaping choice as the attributes that have been manipulated and used to define the alternative offerings. In this article, the authors present several full information models that can accommodate latent variables such as attitudes and satisfaction within the context of binary and multinomial choice models. The models proposed are particularly useful when the focus is on understanding how softer attributes can influence choice decisions. The authors accomplish this by integrating structural equation models within the basic framework of binary and multinomial choice models. Two empirical applications are provided.

Findings from these studies indicate that the originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes.

As such, single ideal point models that assume a single invariant ideal point may be operating from a false and misleading assumption. We propose a multiple ideal point model to capture these multiple preference effects. The basic premise of the model is that consumers may possess a set of ideal points, each of which represents a distinct preference. At any given purchase occasion, one of these points is \u201cactivated\u201d with some probability, and choices are made with respect to its characteristics.

However, no study has compared the relative effectiveness of FM and HB conjoint analysis models in terms of fit, prediction, and parameter recovery. To conduct such a comparison, the authors employ the simulation methodology proposed by Vriens, Wedel, and Wilms with some modification. The authors estimate traditional individual-level conjoint models as well. The authors show that FM and HB models are equally effective in recovering individual-level parameters and predicting ratings of holdout profiles. Two surprising findings are that (1) HB performs well even when partworths come from a mixture of distributions and (2) FM produces good parameter estimates, even at the individual level.

The authors investigate the impact of the level of effort participants must invest to obtain the reward on the types of rewards they prefer and, consequently, on the decision to join the FP. In particular, the authors propose that higher required effort shifts consumer preferences from necessity to luxury rewards, because higher efforts reduce the guilt that is often associated with choosing luxuries over necessities. A series of studies with approximately 3100 consumers demonstrated that (1) higher program requirements shift preferences in favor of luxury rewards, (2) this effect is also observed when consumers choose between luxury and necessity rewards (of the same value) that they themselves proposed, and (3) the effect of program requirements on reward preferences is stronger among consumers who tend to feel guilty about luxury consumption and among those for whom the effort is invested in the context of work rather than pleasure. In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher requirements signal higher value of luxury rewards, the authors show that (1) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer's effort is higher, the shift in preference toward luxuries is still observed and (2) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the FP decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards.

Support for this perspective is obtained in a series of experiments that explores the effects of feature omission in the context of both overt omission (in which the omission is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit omission (in which the omission, though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e.g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the omission of an element related to the brand name.

Findings from a series of experiments indicate that the incentive that is offered in a loyalty program is important to whether the program succeeds or fails at building brand loyalty. The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.2.202.19085","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of loyalty programs and their effectiveness in building brand loyalty without addressing any social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The authors present an empirical comparison of several procedures for eliciting WTP that are applicable directly at the point of purchase. In particular, the authors test the applicability of Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) well-known incentive-compatible procedure for assessing the utility of lotteries to measuring consumers' WTP. In three studies, the authors explore the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the procedure and show that it yields lower WTP estimates than do non-incentive-compatible methods such as open-ended and double-bounded contingent valuation. They show experimentally that differences in WTP estimates arise from the incentive constraint rather than the cognitive effort required in responding.

A Behaviorist Approach to Targeted Promotions","Increased access to individual customers and their purchase histories has led to a growth in targeted promotions, including the practice of offering different pricing policies to prospective, as opposed to current, customers. Prior research on targeted promotions has adopted a tenet of the standard economic theory of choice, whereby what a consumer chooses depends exclusively on the prices available to that consumer. In this article, the authors propose that consumer preference for firms is affected not just by prices the consumers themselves are offered but also by prices available to others. This departure from the conventional strong-rationality approach to targeted promotion results in a decidedly different optimal policy. Through a laboratory experiment, calibration of a stochastic model, and game-theoretic analysis, the authors demonstrate that ignoring behaviorist effects exaggerates the importance of targeting switchers as opposed to loyals. This occurs, though with intriguing differences, even when only part of the market is aware of firms\u2019 differing promotional policies. The authors show that both the deal percentage and the proportion of aware consumers affect the optimal strategy of the firm. Furthermore, the authors find that offering lower prices to switchers may not be a sustainable practice in the long run, as information spreads and the proportion of aware consumers grows. The model cautions practitioners against overpromoting and/or promoting to the wrong segment and suggests avenues for improving the effectiveness of targeted promotional policies.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.3.277.19108","research article","JMR","Marketing","3","['targeted promotions', 'consumer preference', 'pricing policies']","The article discusses consumer behavior and pricing strategies but lacks a strong focus on social justice or ethical considerations.

A significant driver of this primary demand effect is consumer stockpiling in response to price promotions. Indeed, experimental studies have shown that additional inventory on hand can lead to an endogenous increase in consumption. The authors develop a model of price competition between firms in response to the stockpiling and subsequent consumption dynamics of consumers. In this setting, the flexible consumption effect causes more intense price competition, deeper promotions, and an increase in the frequency of promotions. The authors use two years of scanner panel data from eight product categories and 4313 stockkeeping units to test three implications of the theoretical model; they find strong support for each.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.3.292.19103","research article","JMR","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on price competition and consumer behavior without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

In this specific context, temporal (in)consistency captures the degree of variability of prices, displays, and features, as well as availability over time, for a stockkeeping unit. The authors find that sales promotion mix consistency over time affects both consumer utility mean and scale and thus consumers\u2019 choices and brand shares.

Using dual component models of recognition memory, the author examines whether repetition, in the face of repetitions by similar competitors, might paradoxically increase memory confusion. In Experiment 1, the repetition of similar claims of equally familiar competitor brands produced two opposing effects: It increased memory for accurate claim recognition but also elevated brand claim confusion among advertised competitors. The pattern of results was similar when memory was tested a week after the initial exposure. In Experiment 2, in which participants were required to engage in a task designed to promote the \u201cbinding\u201d between a brand and its claim, the memory confusion effects of repetition were significantly reduced. Finally, Experiment 3 replicated and generalized these findings by using more realistic stimuli and procedures.

The authors answer this question by using persistence modeling on weekly sales data of a perishable and a storable product derived from a scanner panel. Their analysis reveals, first, that permanent promotion effects are virtually absent for each sales component. Next, the authors develop and apply an impulse response approach to estimate the promotional adjustment period and the total dynamic effects of a price promotion. Specifically, they calculate the long-term equivalent of Gupta's (1988) 14/84/2 breakdown of promotional effects. Because of positive adjustment effects for incidence but negative adjustment effects for choice, the authors find a reversal of the importance of category incidence and brand choice: 66/11/23 for the storable product and 58/39/3 for the perishable product.

Models with continuous representations of heterogeneity fit the data better than models with discrete representations of heterogeneity. The goal of the current study is to compare the relative performance of logit choice models with discrete versus continuous representations of heterogeneity in terms of the accuracy of household-level parameters, fit, and forecasting accuracy. To accomplish this goal, the authors conduct an extensive simulation experiment with logit models in a scanner data context, using an experimental design based on AAC and other recent simulation studies. One of the main findings is that models with continuous and discrete representations of heterogeneity recover household-level parameter estimates and predict holdout choices about equally well except when the number of purchases per household is small, in which case the models with continuous representations perform very poorly.

While traditional local search algorithms make a single move at each iteration, dynasearch allows a series of moves to be performed. The aim is for the lookahead capabilities of dynasearch to prevent the search from being attracted to poor local optima. We evaluate dynasearch by applying it to the problem of scheduling jobs on a single machine to minimize the total weighted tardiness of the jobs. Dynasearch is more effective than traditional first-improve or best-improve descent in our computational tests. Furthermore, this superiority is much greater for starting solutions close to previous local minima.

This problem can be briefly described as the problem of sequencing a predetermined set of parts with known processing-time requirements through anr-station assembly line so that the makespan is minimized. A set of concurrent operations must be performed at each station on each part. This set of operations is usually partdependent since different parts have different processing requirements. In this paper, we construct schedules in quadratic time for this strongly NP-hard problem with an absolute performance guarantee independent of the number of jobs. This makes our schedules asymptotically optimal as the number of jobs becomes very large. The implementation of our schedules facilitates the efficient use of concurrent operations and prevents the assembly line from degenerating into performing operations serially, which would result in low production rates. We utilize compact vector summation techniques and first construct a schedule for the case where each concurrent operation is performed by a single machine.

A common approach is to route along the shortest available path connecting the source to the destination, where link lengths can be defined in a variety of ways (e.g., time, cost, impact on average queueing delay, or capacity required). This paper presents a family of novel minimax models for determining a set of paths from the source to the destination that are reasonably short in length while also reasonably diverse (disjoint). The overall goal is to design a routing scheme that is both ef.cient and robust, resulting in greater network reliability. Several models are investigated and a column-generation approach is proposed for exact solution. Computational results show that this exact technique can be applied effectively to moderate sized networks. For even larger networks, heuristic methods are developed and tested.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.14.1.81.7707","","JOC","Information Systems","3","['diverse', 'routing', 'reliability']","The article discusses routing models that aim for diversity in paths, which could imply a consideration of equitable access in network management.

The minimum average query complexity is guaranteed via recursion, where partially ordered sets (posets) make up the overlapping subproblems. For problems with up to 4 variables, the posets' optimality conditions are summarized in the form of an evaluative criterion. The evaluative criterion extends then computational feasibility to problems involving up to about 20 variables. A frameworkfor unbiased average case comparison of monotone Boolean function inference algorithms is developed using unequal probability sampling. The unbiased empirical results show that an implementation of the subroutine considered as a standard in the literature performs almost twice as many queries as the evaluative criterion on the average. It should also be noted that the first algorithm ever designed for this problem performed consistently within two percentage points of the evaluative criterion.

Researchers generally assume that algorithms with superior performance on difficult, random test problems will also perform well on more realistic, structured problems. Our research explores this assumption for the permutation flow-shop scheduling problem. We introduce a method for generating structured flow-shop problems, which are modeled after features found in some real-world manufacturing environments. We perform experiments that indicate significant differences exist between the search-space topologies of random and structured flow-shop problems, and demonstrate that these differencescanaffect the performance of certain algorithms. Yet despite these differences, and in contrast to difficult random problems, the majority of structured flow-shop problems were easily solved to optimality by most algorithms. For the problems not optimally solved, differences in performance were minor. We conclude that more realistic, structured permutation flow-shop problems are actually relatively easy to solve. Our results also raise doubts as to whether superior performance on difficult random scheduling problems translates into superior performance on more realistic kinds of scheduling problems.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.14.2.98.120","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of algorithm performance in scheduling problems without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Many of these transforms, particularly in M/G/1 priority queueing applications, tend to be cumbersome expressions that involve both implicit and recursive functional relationships. Due to these complications, even the task of deriving moments becomes an algebraically intensive exercise. The focus of this paper is to describe a collection of efficient symbolic procedures useful for automating the tedious mathematical computations one encounters in working with these kinds of transforms. Central to this development is the introduction of a set-partition operator that enables moment expressions for delay cycles to be determined quickly and exactly, without having to derive any sort of higher-order derivative or Taylor-series expansion. Making use of this operator eliminates laborious derivations by hand and permits moments of various priority queueing-related quantities to be easily determined. In particular, the procedures are applied to the classical non-preemptive and preemptive resume queues, as well as two advanced variants of these models.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.14.3.261.115","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical mathematical procedures related to queueing theory without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring a 1 for lack of woke themes."],["2002","14","3","Jackie ReesJackie Reesjrees@mgmt.purdue.eduKrannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1310, USASearch for more papers by this author, Gary J.

Yet much of a modeling language's underlying structure for expressing integer programs is equally useful for describing more general combinatorial optimization constructs. Constraint programming solvers offer an alternative approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems, in which natural combinatorial constructs are addressed directly within the solution procedure. Hence the growing popularity of constraint programming motivates a variety of extensions to algebraic modeling languages for the purpose of describing combinatorial problems and conveying them to solvers. We examine some of these language extensions along with the significant changes in solver interface design that they require. In particular, we describe how several useful combinatorial features have been added to the AMPL modeling language and how AMPL's general-purpose solver interface has been adapted accordingly. As an illustration of a solver connection, we provide examples from an AMPL driver for ILOG Solver.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.14.4.322.2825","","JOC","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of algebraic modeling languages and combinatorial optimization without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is often able to reduce the size of the search space significantly. For many problems, however, the computational effort required to achieve this reduction in search space is prohibitive. We introduce an algorithm that uses intelligent backtracking inside a linear-programming based branch-and-bound framework. We show that minimal infeasible sets can immediately be deduced from the dual extreme ray associated with the infeasible linear program. This allows us to obtain the reduction in search space associated with intelligent backtracking, without paying the large computational cost.

Using data from a primary survey of hospitals and from various secondary sources, we investigate the incremental effects on hospital performance of location, strategy, and technology. We find that hospital location is significantly related to performance, but that a hospital\u2019s choice of strategy can moderate the effect of location. Additionally, we find hospitals that invest more extensively in clinical technologies tend to be better performers regardless of location. Hospital size, measured as number of beds, captures the effects of location and technology investment in accounting for a major portion of hospital performance. While we cannot argue that larger is always better for hospitals, mergers, partnerships, and other forms of consolidation currently observed in the marketplace indicate that managers in the hospital industry understand the advantage of size.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2801%2900081-X","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of hospital performance related to location, strategy, and technology without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, NSD remains among the least studied and understood topics in the service management literature. As a result, our current understanding of the critical resources and activities to develop new services is inadequate given NSD\u2019s importance as a service competitiveness driver. Until recently, the generally accepted principle behind NSD was that \u201cnew services happen\u201d rather than occurring through formal development processes. Recent efforts to address this debate have been inconclusive. Thus, additional research is needed to validate or discredit the belief that new services happen as a result of intuition, flair, and luck. Relying upon the general distinctions between research exploitation and exploration, this paper describes areas in NSD research that deserve further leveraging and refinement (i.e. exploitation) and identifies areas requiring discovery or new study (i.e. exploration). We discuss the critical substantive and research design issues facing NSD scholars such as defining new services, choice in focusing on the NSD process or performance (or both), and specification of unit of analysis. We also examine what can be exploited from the study of new product development to further understanding of NSD. Finally, we explore one important area for future NSD research exploration: the impact of the Internet on the design and development of services. We offer research opportunities and research challenges in the study of NSD throughout the paper.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2801%2900091-2","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on the technical aspects of new service development without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

Unfortunately, there has been a wide gap between inspiring applications of the Internet that help increase service customization while maintaining or even improving delivery efficiency, and downright flops in which companies that have made bold promises have failed to deliver on even a portion of their pledges. This paper provides an examination of e-services utilizing three approaches in order to provide guidance on how to fly rather than flop. First, we develop a model of the e-service customer retention. Second, we offer a case study of Sothebys.com to illustrate how a well-known, but not typically technologically adventurous, company can utilize e-services to expand its offerings and streamline its services. Finally, we offer a profiling technique for analyzing the benefits and challenges of e-services for particular industries.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2801%2900093-6","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['e-services', 'customer retention', 'delivery efficiency']","The article focuses primarily on operational benefits and efficiency in e-services without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical implications.

This paper examines the effect of SCI on the relationship between diversification and a firm\u2019s competitive performance. The results of the study can be useful in integrating supply chain strategy into market and product diversification (PD) strategy. By comparing the main and interaction effects of SCI and diversification on performance, the paper shows that SCI strategy modifies the relationship between diversification and performance. Additionally, it is argued that coordinated use of SCI and diversification strategies has a significant effect on firm performance.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900008-6","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain integration and performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Knowledge and communication are represented as antecedents of relationship quality and integration in a structural equations model (SEM). All relationships are posited to be positive, and we test whether they are moderated by (1) high versus low environmental uncertainty, and by (2) a high versus low rate of new product introduction as compared to competitors. In all cases but low uncertainty, the majority of structural paths are positive. Nevertheless, a strong, positive link exists between knowledge and integration in the low uncertainty case. Overall, we find that the more marketing knows about manufacturing and the more marketing is able to communicate credibly with manufacturing, better relationships and functional relationships will result with a variety of contingencies notwithstanding.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900009-8","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of the manufacturing-marketing interface and relationship quality without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Drawing on the literature and prior empirical work in M/M strategies, we propose a path model for assessing the mediating impact of the M/M interface harmony\u2014the functions\u2019 ability to work together\u2014on M/M morale and business performance. Using two convenience samples of executives, we empirically test the direct and indirect influence of predisposing factors (antecedents) and performance outcomes (consequences) that are expected theoretically to influence or be influenced by M/M interface harmony.\n            \n            We find that 11 of the 13 hypothesized direct effects are significant at the 0.012 level or below; and attesting to the mediating influence of the M/M ability to work together, 11 of the 12 indirect effects were significant at the 0.02 level or below. Increasing the emphasis on the importance of marketing or manufacturing, or both, improves the ability of both functions to work harmoniously, which in turn impacts M/M morale. Interfunctional harmony appears to have a stronger influence on each function\u2019s morale than the importance attached to that function, ceteris paribus. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the study provides insight on the distinctive roles whereby marketing and manufacturing functions influence performance. Marketing acts to improve competitive position and profitability through the mediating influence of M/M interface harmony and improved marketing morale. However, manufacturing morale was not shown to be a significant factor impacting performance. Rather, emphasis on manufacturing impacts competitive position directly, as indicated by the resource-based view of manufacturing strategy. This exploratory study provides new empirical evidence that the M/M interface harmony, as expressed by the functions\u2019 ability to work together, matters significantly to business outcomes directly and indirectly.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900010-4","","JOM","Operations Management","2","['harmony', 'morale', 'collaboration']","The article discusses the importance of collaboration and morale between marketing and manufacturing functions, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We present the results of a controlled experiment within a larger data collection effort. The same survey instrument was completed by 416 Internet customers of a major office supplies company, with approximately 60% receiving the survey in paper form and 40% receiving the electronic version. In order to evaluate the efficacy of electronic surveys relative to traditional, printed surveys we conduct two levels of analysis. On a macro-level, we compare the two groups for similarity in terms of fairly aggregate, coarse data characteristics such as response rates, proportion of missing data, scale means and inter-item reliability. On a more fine-grained, micro-level, we compare the two groups for aspects of data integrity such as the presence of data runs and measurement errors. This deeper, finer-grained analysis allows an examination of the potential benefits and flaws of electronic data collection.\n            \n            Our findings suggest that electronic surveys are generally comparable to print surveys in most respects, but that there are a few key advantages and challenges that researchers should evaluate. Notably, our sample indicates that electronic surveys have fewer missing responses and can be coded/presented in a more flexible manner (namely, contingent coding with different respondents receiving different questions depending on the response to earlier questions) that offers researchers new capabilities.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900004-9","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical comparison of survey methodologies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

It is characterized by interorganizational coordination: companies working jointly with their customers and suppliers to integrate activities along the supply chain to effectively supply product to customers. More developed SCM is indicated by systematic integration, i.e. standardized and automatic interorganizational interfaces. Information technology (IT) engenders such systematic integration by allowing more efficient and automatic information flow.\n            \n            This research focuses on electronic data interchange (EDI), an important class of IT used for interorganizational information transfers in the supply chain. Data from a survey of the food industry is used to examine the use of EDI with respect to interfirm coordination activities involving suppliers and customers. The influence of demographic characteristics on EDI use is also investigated. The results suggest that firms view EDI as a tool for improving efficiencies rather than as a tool for facilitating supply chain integration. There is also a surprising difference in firms use of EDI with customers vis-\u00e0-vis suppliers. Firms tend to be much more accommodating of the desires of their customers than of their suppliers.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900017-7","technical note","JOM","Operations Management","2","['demographic', 'coordination', 'efficiencies']","The article primarily focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and the use of electronic data interchange, with minimal emphasis on social themes.

In this high-change and complex environment, firms face high levels of uncertainty and equivocality, and in response, they seek integrative structural mechanisms. In these organizations, product development is characterized by the use of heavyweight product development managers, concurrent engineering, and computer usage. These mechanisms give product development efforts the senior leadership to overcome resistance, the ability to integrate and coordinate activities, the access to relevant information, and the ability to process it effectively. This research describes a framework for product development practices, and it discusses relations among these variables as well as important performance variables (product innovation, quality, premium pricing, and profitability). Based on responses from 244 manufacturing firms, the study suggests that heavyweight product development managers drive the application of concurrent engineering and computer use. Computer use has a significant and positive impact on product innovation, and concurrent engineering has a positive effect on quality. Product innovation also seems to have an influence on quality. Both quality and product innovation have a significant and positive impact on premium pricing, which, in turn, influences profitability. The extent to which a firm uses a product platform strategy seems to be an important contextual variable that affects the nature of the relationships among product development practices and competitive capabilities. Firms operating in uncertain or equivocal environments appear to adopt higher levels of integrated product development practices than firms operating in low uncertainty or low equivocality environments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900018-9","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product development and competitive capabilities without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

As success in the business world depends on the ability to do more with less, it is important for these high technology firms to understand why certain projects consume less monetary resources but still achieve superior product development outcomes. To address this question, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding the interdependencies between projects and their relationship to project performance in a multiple-concurrent R&D environment. The framework is developed through multiple-case studies of projects undertaken by a Fortune 500 high technology manufacturing firm. The seven projects that comprised the sample for the multiple-case study were chosen from a larger portfolio of projects belonging to a technology group at the firm\u2019s corporate R&D center. The choice of the seven projects was guided by a data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based project performance metric, also proposed in this paper.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900024-4","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of project management and performance in high-tech R&D environments, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Manufacturing\u2019s response to business success in small and medium enterprises","This study examined how the operations in six New Zealand manufacturers responded to the turbulence in their business environment brought on by the success of their products. It was carried out in response to various calls in the business and operations strategies literature for more studies on how companies create configurations of capabilities that lead to competitive advantage, how these literature can be better integrated, and on internal fit within manufacturing. Case research and historiographic methods were used to record the competitive evolution of these firms. The study used semi-structured interviews with Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and operations managers, analysis of company and public records and a manufacturing practices survey instrument. We suggest that when small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with sudden and dramatic success from an innovation, they need to focus the company\u2019s energy and resources on that product and its niche. Then, in terms of manufacturing strategy, the key attribute to develop is an operation that can produce short runs at little or no cost penalty, achieve requisite product variety, provide short manufacturing throughput times, and operate at high levels of quality and delivery dependability. We find that an approach that develops manufacturing capabilities that are related to market requirements is preferred to panacea-based approaches. Also, we see no common pattern in manufacturing capability development.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900026-8","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on operational strategies and competitive advantage without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

However, modularity is not a dichotomous property of a product, as different types of modularity can be embedded into a product family architecture. The present paper explores how manufacturing characteristics affect the appropriate type of modularity to be embedded into the product family architecture, and how the types of modularity relate to component sourcing. The study is based on a qualitative research design involving a multiple case study methodology to examine six product families belonging to six European companies. The themes derived through case analyses are synthesized in the form of empirical generalizations. Insights from these empirical generalizations are subsequently developed into two propositions explaining why and under what conditions these empirical generalizations might hold for a product family outside of the original sample. The theoretical results formalize, first of all, a type of modularity (i.e. combinatorial modularity) not currently described in literature. Second, the theoretical propositions suggest that when the desired level of product variety is low (high) relative to total production volume, component swapping modularity (combinatorial modularity) helps to maximize operational performance. Finally, the complexity of component families outsourced to suppliers and the geographical proximity of component family suppliers affect the extent to which the product variety\u2013operational performance trade-off can be mitigated through modularity.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900027-X","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of operations management without addressing social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

However, while batching is also employed in mass services, it is not clear to what extent the manufacturing theory may be transferred. A single case study of a court scheduling service system with imbedded instances of batching was studied to address this question. The findings and analysis of the case indicate that while the factors that affect batching in manufacturing still apply, so do additional factors. The net effect is a broader set of considerations which influence the determination of when batching is desired in mass services and how big batches should be. Definitions of these factors, their relationships with batch size, and testable hypotheses are offered.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900028-1","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of job batching in manufacturing and mass services without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Researchers have responded with a great deal of theoretical and empirical work aimed at identifying factors that influence the performance of these teams. Scholars, however, have tended to focus their research on variables human resource managers can readily control (e.g. the composition of teams relative to members\u2019 characteristics, team goals) and little emphasis has been placed on factors inherent to production systems. Identifying factors in the production system that influence team effectiveness is crucial because many of these factors are not changeable in the short term. Accordingly, these production system factors are likely to be a crucial factor when deciding whether or not to organize a production system around teams. In a departure from past research, this article reports a qualitative study aimed at identifying factors in operational systems that influence team effectiveness. Our qualitative results suggest that four characteristics of the operational system influence team effectiveness: work organized around the team\u2019s output, opportunities for informal communication, work that includes novel problems to solve, and management trust in teams.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900030-X","","JOM","Operations Management","3","['team effectiveness', 'human resource', 'management trust']","The article discusses team effectiveness and management trust, which are relevant to organizational practices, but it lacks a strong focus on social justice or DEI themes.

Because of the richness of the case study data, we delve deeper than other studies into the actions of teams and management to better understand how and why successful performance improvement teams evolve as they do. Stated in temporal order, our main hypotheses are: work team engagement is positively associated with early implementation credibility-building activities; both outcome-orientation and substantive participation are positively associated with a rapid rate of performance gains; and team institutionalization is positively associated with sustaining performance gains. The findings of the case studies and the associated hypotheses are summarized in a time-phased framework for work team implementation.

The concepts of supply chain management (SCM), and its extension demand chain management (DCM), have been at the center of much recent research. One of the reasons for this is that, over the last years, a significant number of information systems have emerged, which claim to support the concept. The paper argues that these systems mostly adopt a myopic view of planning, based on pure deterministic planning methods. It demonstrates that such an approach fails to coop with the considerable uncertainty of the planning information. The proposed robust planning paradigm is then introduced and its impact explained, using the well-known example of the beer game. It holds the promise of reducing the number of re-planning cycles, through a better characterization of the expected service level performance over a medium planning horizon. Finally, a case study will show the value of robust planning in a European chemical enterprise.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0272-6963%2802%2900039-6","","JOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand chain planning and risk assessment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

EKPs are organizational activity patterns that exhibit three characteristics in combination:  an emergent process of deliberations with no best structure or sequence; requirements for knowledge that are complex (both general and situational), distributed across people, and evolving dynamically; and an actor set that is unpredictable in terms of job roles or prior knowledge.  Examples of EKPs include basic research, new product development, strategic business planning, and organization design.  EKPs differ qualitatively from semi-structured decision making processes; therefore, they have unique requirements that are not all thoroughly supported by familiar classes of systems, such as executive information systems, expert systems, electronic communication systems, organizational memory systems, or repositories.  Further, the development literature on familiar classes of systems does not provide adequate guidance on how to build systems that support EKPs.  Consequently, EKPs require a new IS design theory, as explicated by Walls et al. (1992).\n\nWe created such a theory while designing and deploying a system for the EKP of organization design.  The system was demonstrated through subsequent empirical analysis to be successful in supporting the process.  Abstracting from the experience of building this system, we developed an IS design theory for EKP support systems.  This new IS design theory is an important theoretical contribution, because it both provides guidance to developers and sets an agenda for academic research.  EKP design theory makes the development process more tractable for developers by restricting the range of effective features (or rules for selecting features) and the range of effective development practices to a more manageable set.  EKP design theory also sets an agenda for academic research by articulating theory-based principles that are subject to empirical, as well as practical, validation.","https://misq.umn.edu/a-design-theory-for-systems-that-supoprt-emergent-knowledge-processes.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","2","['emergent processes', 'organizational activity', 'knowledge processes']","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of information systems design without significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

Drawing from economic, sociological, and marketing theories and using data from both an online experiment and an online auction market, we demonstrate that appropriate feedback mechanisms can induce calculus-based credibility trust without repeated interactions between two transacting parties. Trust can mitigate information asymmetry by reducing transaction-specific risks, therefore generating price premiums for reputable sellers.  In addition, the research also examines the role that trust plays in mitigating the risks inherent in transactions that involve very expensive products.","https://misq.umn.edu/evidence-of-the-effect-of-trust-building-technology-in-electronic-markets-price-premiums-and-buyer-behavior.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","3","['trust', 'feedback mechanisms', 'information asymmetry']","The article discusses trust in electronic markets and the role of feedback mechanisms, but it primarily focuses on economic and transactional outcomes rather than social justice or ethical critiques.

The purpose of this paper is to highlight the lack of attention paid to the unintended consequences of managing organizational knowledge and thereby to broaden the scope of IS-based knowledge management research. To this end, this paper analyzes the IS literature on knowledge management.

These discourses are the normative, the interpretive, the critical, and the dialogic.  For each of these discourses, we identify the research focus, the metaphors of knowledge, the theoretical foundations, and the implications apparent in the articles representing it.

When compared to broad traits, the model suggests that situation-specific traits exert a more pervasive influence on IT situation-specific individual differences.

Results provide support for many of the hypothesized relationships.

However, despite the importance of the software industry to the world economy, few studies have attempted to empirically examine these characteristics, or several others which theory suggests impact software price.  This study develops and tests a research-grounded model of two-sided software markets that accounts for several key factors influencing software pricing, including network externalities, cross-market complementarities, standards, mindshare, and trialability.  Applying the model to the context of the market for Web server software, several key findings are offered.  First, a positive market share to price relationship is identified, offering support for the network externalities hypothesis even though the market examined is based on open standards.  Second, the results suggest that the market under study behaves as a two-sided market in that firms able to capture market share for one product enjoy benefits in terms of both market share and price for the complement.  Third, the positive price benefits of securing consumer mindshare, of supporting dominant standards, and from offering a trial product are demonstrated.  Last, a negative price shock is also identified in the period after a well-known, free-pricing rival has entered the market.  Nonetheless, network effects continued to remain significant during the period.  These findings enhance our understanding of software markets, offer new techniques for examining such markets, and suggest the wisdom of allocating resources to develop advantages in the factors studied.","https://misq.umn.edu/understanding-network-effects-in-software-markets-evidence-from-web-server-pricing.html","","MISQ","Information Systems","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of software pricing and market dynamics without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The life-cycle hypothesis from economics argues that consumers should intertemporally reallocate their incomes over their life stream to maximize lifetime utility. One form of intertemporal allocation is to use past income (in the form of savings) in the future. A second form is the use of future income in the present. This can only be done if consumers have access to a temporary pool of money that they can draw from and replenish in the future\u2014a function performed by consumer credit. However, our research reinforces prior findings that consumers are unable to correctly value their future incomes, and that they lack the cognitive capability to solve the intertemporal optimization problem required by the life-cycle hypothesis. Instead, we argue that consumers use information such as the credit limit as a signal of their future earnings potential. Specifically, if consumers have access to large amounts of credit, they are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be high and hence their willingness to use credit (and their spending) will also be high. Conversely, consumers who are granted lower amounts of credit are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be low and hence their spending will be lower.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.1.32.155","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on consumer credit decisions and economic theories without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When using services in these industries, consumers pay for the privilege of accessing the firm's facilities but do not acquire any right to the facility itself. A firm's pricing decisions in access industries frequently come down to a simple choice among flat fee pricing, usage pricing, or two-part tariff pricing. However, it is not so simple for firms in those industries to make this choice. Access service firms typically face a mix of consumers who have intrinsically different usage rates. A key characteristic of access service firms, however, is that the cost of providing an additional minute of usage is typically negligible, as long as the firm has the necessary capacity to serve its customers. Service capacity, which corresponds to the total available time on a firm's system, is often limited.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.2.139.149","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on pricing strategies in access service industries without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

New product sales growth in a given nation or society is affected by many factors (Rogers 1995), and of these, sociocontagion (or word of mouth) has been found to be the most important factor that characterizes the diffusion process (Bass 1969, Moore 1995). Hence, it is interesting and perhaps challenging to analyze what would happen if a new product diffuses in parallel in two neighboring but culturally different countries. Not only will we expect the diffusion process in the two countries to be different, but we will also expect some interaction among them, especially if the two societies mingle with each other. There are two streams of research in cross-national diffusion. The first type focuses on exploring the differences between diffusion processes in two countries and finding out whether those differences can be attributed to social and cultural differences between the countries involved. Examples of this type of research are found in Takada and Jain (1991), Gatignon et al. (1989), Helsen et al. (1993), and Kumar et al. (1998). These studies did find some relationship between the cultural differences of the countries studied and the differences in the diffusion process. The second stream of research focuses on modeling explicitly the interaction between the diffusion processes in two countries. The interaction is typically captured through lead-lag effect (Eliashberg and Helsen 1996, Kalish et al. 1995), where the sales process in the lead country (i.e., the country where the product was first introduced) is modeled to affect the sales process in the lag country (i.e., the country where the product was introduced a few years later).","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.3.318.139","","MKS","Marketing","2","['cultural differences', 'sociocontagion', 'diffusion process']","The article discusses cultural differences in the context of product diffusion, which hints at some awareness of social factors.

Variety is a key property of assortments. Assortment variety can determine consumers' store choice and is only gaining in importance with today's increasing numbers of product offerings. To support retailers in managing their assortments, insight is needed into the influence of assortment composition on consumers' variety perceptions, and appropriate measures of assortment variety are required. This paper aims to extend the assortment variety model recently proposed by Hoch et al. (1999) in Marketing Science. It conceptualizes assortment variety from an attribute-based perspective and compares this with the productbased approach of Hoch, Bradlow, and Wansink (HBW). The attribute- based approach offers an alternative viewpoint for assortment variety. Attribute- and product-based approaches reflect basic conceptualizations of assortment variety that assume substantially different perception processes: a consumer comparing products one-by-one versus a consumer examining attributes across products in the assortment. While the product-based approach focuses on the dissimilarity between product pairs in an assortment, the attribute-based approach that we propose focuses on the marginal and joint distributions of the attributes. We conjecture and aim to show that an attribute-based approach suffices to predict consumers' perceptions of assortment variety.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.3.331.144","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of category management and assortment variety without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We focus on one data source\u2014advance purchase orders\u2014that has been available to retailers for many years but has rarely been tied together with postlaunch sales data. We put forth a duration model that incorporates the basic concepts of new product diffusion, using a mixture of two distributions: one representing the behavior of innovators (i.e., those who place advance orders) and one representing the behavior of followers (i.e., those who wait for the mass market to emerge). The resulting mixed-Weibull model specification can accommodate a wide variety of possible sales patterns. This flexibility is what makes the model well-suited for an experiential product category (e.g., movies, music, etc.) in which we frequently observe very different sales diffusion patterns, ranging from a rapid exponential decline (which is most typical) to a gradual buildup characteristic of \u201csleeper\u201d products. We incorporate product-specific covariates and use hierarchical Bayes methods to link the two customer segments together while accommodating heterogeneity across products. We find that this model fits a variety of sales patterns far better than do a pair of benchmark models.

In the first study, using observational data from two US supermarket chains, we found that store brands are more likely to target stronger national brands. Our second study estimated cross-price effects in 19 product categories, and found that only in categories with high-quality store brands, store brand and the leading national brand compete more intensely with each other than with the secondary national brand. In a third product perception study, we found that although explicit targeting by store brands influenced consumer perceptions of physical similarity, it had no influence on consumers' perceptions of overall or product quality similarity.

In this paper, we derive a measure of market value such that the comparison of the measure against the incremental unit cost of the attribute improvement is key in deciding whether or not the attribute improvement is profitable. Competition from other brands, the potential for market expansion, and heterogeneity in customer preference structures are explicitly modeled using the multinomial logit framework. The analysis yields a closed form expression for the market's value for an attribute improvement (MVAI). A key result we obtain is that customers should be differentially weighted based on their probability of purchasing the firm's product. In particular, customers who exhibit a very high or very low probability of choosing the firm's product should receive less weight in detemining MVAI. Because the probability of choice varies across products, the answer to the question of how much the market values an improvement depends on which firm is asking the question. It is shown that customers whose utilities have a greater random component should be weighted less. Furthermore, the measure developed is robust to the influence of outliers in the sample. An empirical illustration of the MVAI measure in the context of a new product development study is provided. The study illustrates the advantages of the proposed measure over currently used approaches and explores the possibility of competitive price reactions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.4.398.130","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on market valuation of product attributes without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This paper analyzes the effect of referral infomediaries on retail markets and examines the contractual arrangements that they should use in selling their services. We identify the conditions necessary for the infomediary to exist and explain how they would evolve with the growth of the Internet. The role of an infomediary as a price discrimination mechanism leads to lower online prices. Perhaps the most interesting result is that the referral infomediary can unravel (i.e., no retailer can get any net profit gain from joining) when its reach becomes too large. The analysis also shows why referral infomediaries would prefer to offer geographical exclusivity to joining retailers.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.21.4.412.135","","MKS","Marketing","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of referral infomediaries and their impact on retail markets without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

The results also indicate that the key channels through which university research impacts industrial R&D include published papers and reports, public conferences and meetings, informal information exchange, and consulting.

New codes and formulae describing discoveries develop slowly-with little incentive if value is low and many competing opportunities if high. Hence new knowledge remains naturally excludable and appropriable. Team production allows more knowledge capture of tacit, complex discoveries by firm scientists. A robust indicator of a firm's tacit knowledge capture (and strong predictor of its success) is the number of research articles written jointly by firm scientists and discovering, \u201cstar\u201d scientists, nearly all working at top universities. An operationally attractive generalization of our star measure-collaborative research articles between firm scientists and top research university scientists-replicates the impact on firm success. In panel analyses, publications by firm scientists with stars and/or top 112 university scientists increase the number and citation rate for firm patents. Further, star articles increase these rates significantly more than other top 112 university scientists' articles. Cross-sectional analyses of products and employment show a similar pattern of positive effects on firms' success of collaborations with stars or top university scientists, but estimates of differential effects are nonrobust due to multicollinearity.

We use network visualization methods and correspondence analyses to demonstrate that innovative research in biomedicine has its origins in regional clusters in the United States and in European nations. But the scientific and organizational composition of these regions varies in consequential ways. In the United States, public research organizations and small firms conduct R&D across multiple therapeutic areas and stages of the development process. Ties within and across these regions link small firms and diverse public institutions, contributing to the development of a robust national network. In contrast, the European story is one of regional specialization with a less diverse group of public research organizations working in a smaller number of therapeutic areas. European institutes develop local connections to small firms working on similar scientific problems, while cross-national linkages of European regional clusters typically involve large pharmaceutical corporations. We show that the roles of large and small firms differ in the United States and Europe, arguing that the greater heterogeneity of the U.S. system is based on much closer integration of basic science and clinical development.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.1.24.14275","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['diverse', 'public research organizations', 'regional clusters']","The article discusses the organizational differences in life sciences research across the U.S. and Europe, mentioning 'diverse' public research organizations and 'regional clusters', which hints at some awareness of diversity in research settings.

Most faculty members estimate that patents account for less than 10% of the knowledge that transfers from their labs. Our results also suggest that in two important ways patenting is not representative of the patterns of knowledge generation and transfer from MIT: patent volume does not predict publication volume, and those firms that cite MIT papers are in general not the same firms as those that cite MIT patents. However, patent volume is positively correlated with paper citations, suggesting that patent counts may be reasonable measures of research impact.

Sources of Growth in University Licensing","Historically, commercial use of university research has been viewed in terms of spillovers. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in technology transfer through licensing as universities attempt to appropriate the returns from faculty research. This change has prompted concerns regarding the source of this growth-specifically, whether it suggests a change in the nature of university research. We develop an intermediate input model to examine the extent to which the growth in licensing is due to the productivity of observable inputs or driven by a change in the propensity of faculty and administrators to engage in commercializing university research. We model licensing as a three-stage process, each involving multiple inputs. Nonparametric programming techniques are applied to survey data from 64 universities to calculate total factor productivity (TFP) growth in each stage. To examine the sources of TFP growth, the productivity analysis is augmented by survey evidence from businesses who license-in university inventions. Results suggest that increased licensing is due primarily to an increased willingness of faculty and administrators to license and increased business reliance on external R&D rather than a shift in faculty research.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.1.90.14271","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['commercial use', 'technology transfer', 'university research']","The article primarily focuses on the economic aspects of university licensing and technology transfer, with no significant emphasis on social justice, equity, or ethical critiques.

Optimal portfolios are difficult to define because of the combinatorial complexity of project combinations. However, at the aggregate level of the strategic allocation of resources across product lines, investment in a program is not an all-or-nothing decision, but can be adjusted, resulting in a higher or lower program benefit (e.g., higher or lower quality). In some cases, resources can be adjusted even for individual projects. With this insight, one can use marginal analysis to optimally allocate the scarce budget. This article develops a dynamic model of resource allocation, taking into account multiple interacting factors, such as independent or correlated, uncertain market payoffs that change over time, increasing or decreasing returns from the NPD investment, carry-over of the investment benefit over multiple periods, and interactions across market segments.

In this paper, we study the effects of the introduction of a store-brand into a particular product category. Specifically, we are interested in the effect of store-brand introduction on the demand as well as on the supply side. On the demand side, we investigate the changes in preferences for the national brands and price elasticities in the category. On the supply side, we study the effects of the new entrant on the interactions between the national brand manufacturers and the retailer introducing the store brand, including how these interactions influence the retailer's pricing behavior. In doing so, we are also able to test whether the observed data are consistent with some of the commonly used assumptions regarding retailer pricing behavior. For the demand specification we use a random coefficients logit model that allows for consumer heterogeneity. The model parameters are estimated using aggregate data while explicitly accounting for endogeneity in retail prices. Our empirical results obtained from the oats product category based on store-level data from a multistore retail chain indicate that the store-brand introduction generates notable changes within the category. The store-brand introduction coincides with an increase in the retailer's margins for the national brand. We find that the preferences for the national brand are relatively unaffected by the introduction of the store-brand. While consumers are, in general, more price sensitive (in terms of elasticities) than they were prior to store-brand introduction, a statistical test of the differences in mean price elasticities across stores and between the two regimes fails to reject the hypothesis of no change in these elasticities. Elasticities in specific stores however, do increase after the store brand is introduced. We also find that there is considerable heterogeneity in the preferences for the store-brand. On the supply side, we test several forms of manufacturer-retailer interactions to identify retailer pricing behavior most consistent with the data. Our results indicate that the data reject several, commonly imposed, forms of interactions. In examining the nature of manufacturer interactions with the retailer, we find that the manufacturer of the national brand appears to take a softer stance in its interactions with the retailer subsequent to store-brand entry. This finding is consistent with academic research and with articles in the popular press which suggest that the store brand enhances the retailer's bargaining ability vis-\u00e0-vis the manufacturers of the national brands.

Past findings obtained in controlled contexts (Glynn et al. 1991; Lant 1992) have provided empirical support for the attainment discrepancy model (Lewin et al. 1944), which includes variables of the previous aspiration level and attainment discrepancy (i.e., performance feedback). We replicated these findings in the field: The effects of the previous aspiration level and attainment discrepancy on the current aspiration levels were significant and positive. In addition, we investigated the effect of social comparison using a variable based on the difference between the performance of the focal unit and the performance of comparable others (Greve 1998). Based on the assumption that decision makers in organizations will expect to observe similar performance levels among those in the same comparison group (Wood 1989), we posited that the effect of social comparison would be negative, refiecting managerial efforts to reduce performance discrepancies among similar units. The empirical results supported the prediction from this reasoning.

This paper presents a model of competition between two firms that face scale economies; (i.e., each firm's cost per unit of demand is decreasing in demand). A general framework is used, which incorporates competition between two service providers with price- and time-sensitive demand (a queuing game), and competition between two retailers with fixed-ordering costs and pricesensitive consumers (an Economic Order Quantity game). Reasonably general conditions are provided under which there exists at most one equilibrium, with both firms participating in the market. We demonstrate, in the context of the queuing game, that the lower cost firm in equilibrium may have a higher market share and a higher price, an enviable situation. We also allow each firm to outsource their production process to a supplier. Even if the supplier's technology is no better than the firms' technology and the supplier is required to establish dedicated capacity (so the supplier's scale can be no greater than either firm's scale), we show that the firms strictly prefer to outsource. We conclude that scale economies provide a strong motivation for outsourcing that has not previously been identified in the literature.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.10.1314.271","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of competition and outsourcing without any mention of social themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

Theoretically, this concept has been instrumental in studying consumer purchase decisions,competitive pricing strategies,and welfare economics. Managerially,knowledge of consumer reservation prices is critical for implementing many pricing tactics such as bundling,tar get promotions,nonlinear pricing,and one-to-one pricing,and for assessing the impact of marketing strategy on demand. Despite the practical and theoretical importance of this concept, its measurement at the individual level in a practical setting proves elusive. We propose a conjoint-based approach to estimate consumer-level reservation prices. This approach integrates the preference estimation of traditional conjoint with the economic theory of consumer choice. This integration augments the capability of traditional conjoint such that consumers' reservation prices for a product can be derived directly from the individuallevel estimates of conjoint coefficients. With this augmentation,we can model a consumer's decision of not only which product to buy,but also whether to buy at all in a category. Thus, we can simulate simultaneously three effects that a change in price or the introduction of a new product may generate in a market: the customer switching effect,the cannibalization effect,and the market expansion effect. We show in a pilot application how this approach can aid product and pricing decisions.

New operating room (OR) capacity can be had by building new ORs or extending the working hours in the current ORs. The choice among these options is complicated by the fact that patients, surgeons and surgical staff, and hospital administrators are all important stakeholders in the health service operation, and each has different priorities. This paper investigates the trade-offs among three performance criteria (wait to get on schedule, scheduled procedure start-time reliability, and hospital profits), which are of particular importance to the different constituencies. The objective is to determine how the hospital can best expand its capacity, acknowledging the key role that each constituency plays in that objective.

Each group of buyers has independent, private values for a single unit. Buyers compete directly against each other within a period, as in a traditional auction, and indirectly with buyers in other periods through the opportunity cost of capacity assessed by the seller. The number of buyers in each period, as well as the individual buyers' valuations, are random. The model is a variation of the traditional single leg, multiperiod revenue management problem, in which consumers act strategically and bid for units of a fixed capacity over time. For this setting, we prove that dynamic variants of the first-price and second-price auction mechanisms maximize the seller's expected revenue. We also show explicitly how to compute and implement these optimal auctions. The optimal auctions are then compared to a traditional revenue management mechanism\u2014in which list prices are used in each period together with capacity controls\u2014and to a simple auction heuristic that consists of allocating units to each period and running a sequence of standard, multiunit auctions with fixed reserve prices in each period. The traditional revenue management mechanism is proven to be optimal in the limiting cases when there is at most one buyer per period, when capacity is not constraining, and asymptotically when the number of buyers and the capacity increases. The optimal auction significantly outperforms both suboptimal mechanisms when there are a moderate number of periods, capacity is constrained, and the total volume of sales is not too large. The benefit also increases when variability in the dispersion in buyers' valuations or in the number of buyers per period increases.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.11.1388.269","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of dynamic auctions and revenue management without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

For this purpose, we study the cost effectiveness of restricting the inventory policies to the class of zero-inventory-ordering (ZIO) policies in a single-warehouse multiretailer scenario in which the warehouse serves as a cross-dock facility. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists a ZIO inventory policy whose total inventory and transportation cost is no more than 4/3 (5.6/4.6 if transportation costs are stationary) times the optimal cost. However, finding the best ZIO policy is an NP hard problem as well. Thus, we propose two algorithms to find an effective ZIO policy: An exact algorithm whose running time is polynomial for any fixed number of retailers, and a linear-programming-based heuristic whose effectiveness is demonstrated in a series of computational experiments.

To obtain realistic outcomes, the (limited) description of the uncertainty in such models should also exclude arbitrage opportunities, and thereby be consistent with financial asset pricing theory. We illustrate that the method proposed by H\u00f8yland and Wallace can result in arbitrage opportunities in the scenario tree if only statistical properties are imposed. We show how one can check ex post for the presence of arbitrage opportunities in a scenario tree by checking for the existence of solutions to sets of linear equations.

We examine one dimension of the operation of organization groups, the transfer of experience. Our core argument is that organization groups may create benefits for their members, but problems for those outside the group. Within the group they can facilitate the transfer of experience among their members by creating mechanisms for communication, incentives for helping, and by promoting understanding. The predicted pattern of experience transfer should improve performance of those within the group, but also has implications for those outside it. Experience accumulated in one organization group strengthens the competitiveness of its organizations, and thereby harms competitors outside the group. Thus, organization groups are fundamental both for the functioning of their members and the competitive dynamics of their industries. Our longitudinal analysis of the profitability of kibbutz agriculture supports both these claims. Between 1954 and 1965 (the years of this study), almost all kibbutzim were part of organization groups. Kibbutzim became more profitable as a function of the experience of others in their group.

In contrast, we find that firms in research-intensive industries are more likely to locate in states with high R&D intensity. Foreign firms in the pharmaceutical industry value state R&D intensity the most, at a level twice that of firms in the semiconductor industry, and four times that of electronics firms. Interestingly, not only firms from technically lagging nations, but also some firms from technically leading nations are attracted to R&D intensive states.

The procedure is demonstrated with an application to a fisheries management problem. Trade-off judgments are elicited from a group of fisheries experts with management responsibility in the Lake Erie basin. Then we use a Bayesian method to compute posterior probability distributions of attribute weights. In computing the Bayesian weights, our measurement model assumes that the weight ratios produced by each respondent's judgments are subject to random error and an unknown scale compatibility bias. Ratios are log-transformed and analyzed by a Bayesian linear model with a noninformative prior distribution. Posterior distributions are then developed for the weights and the bias. We estimate the compatibility bias for each person and, in most cases, it is found to be large and in the predicted direction, suggesting the importance of its consideration in deriving trade-off weights. In addition, the Bayesian framework is shown to be useful for quantifying the value of additional information about multiattribute weights. Finally, a simple heuristic procedure for assessing the weights appears to be effective in eliminating the bias.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.12.1555.444","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['bias', 'trade-off', 'management']","The article discusses scale compatibility bias in a technical context related to fisheries management, with no explicit focus on social justice or ethical critiques.

ASAP operates as follows: The batch size is progressively increased until either (a) the batch means pass the von Neumann test for independence, and then ASAP delivers a classical NOBM confidence interval; or (b) the batch means pass the Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality, and then ASAP delivers a correlation-adjusted confidence interval. The latter adjustment is based on an inverted Cornish-Fisher expansion for the classical NOBM t-ratio, where the terms of the expansion are estimated via an autoregressive-moving average time series model of the batch means. After determining the batch size and confidence-interval type, ASAP sequentially increases the number of batches until the precision requirement is satisfied.

This claim uses the fact that many multi-item problems decompose naturally into a set of single-item problems with linking constraints, and that there is now a large body of knowledge about single-item problems.

Specifically, we indicate for each class (i) whether a tight extended formulation is known, and its size; (ii) whether one or more families of valid inequalities are known defining the convex hull of solutions, and the complexity of the corresponding separation algorithms; and (iii) the complexity of the corresponding optimization algorithms (which would be useful if a column generation or Lagrangian relaxation approach was envisaged).

Perturbation methods have to provide legitimate users with accurate (unbiased) information, and also provide adequate security against disclosure of confidential information to snoopers. For databases described by nonnormal multivariate distributions, existing perturbation methods do not provide unbiased characteristics. In this study, we develop a copula-based perturbation method capable of maintaining the marginal distribution of perturbed attributes to be the same before and after perturbation. In addition, this method also preserves the rank order correlation between the confidential and nonconfidential attributes, thereby maintaining monotonic relationships between attributes. The method proposed in this study provides a high level of protection against inferential disclosure.

To survive, firms must respond to these new markets. How do firms develop the capabilities necessary to succeed in such changing conditions? Some suggest that experience with previous entry builds such capabilities. Others suggest that capabilities arise from experience producing and selling to existing markets. The role of managers is also debated. Some argue that experience with existing markets causes managers to miss entry opportunities. Others argue that managers enter new markets when their firm possesses the experience needed to compete effectively. In this paper, we explore these issues by investigating entry patterns in the disk-drive industry. We investigate the effect of experience in existing markets and experience with previous market entry. We find that experience in previous markets increased the probability that a firm would enter a new market. We show that this experience had greater value if the firm entered the new market.

This paper generalizes the Bass model by allowing for a supply constraint. In the presence of a supply constraint, potential customers who are not able to obtain the new product join the waiting queue, generating backorders and potentially reversing their adoption decision, resulting in lost sales. Consequently, they do not generate the positive \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d that is typically assumed in the Bass model, leading to significant changes in the new product diffusion dynamics. We study how a firm should manage its supply processes in a new product diffusion environment with backorders and lost sales. We consider a make-to-stock production environment and use optimal control theory to establish that it is never optimal to delay demand fulfillment. This result is interesting because immediate fulfillment may accelerate the diffusion process and thereby result in a greater loss of customers in the future. Using this result, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting demand and sales dynamics over the product life cycle. We then use these expressions to investigate how the firm should determine the size of its capacity and the time to market its new product. We show that delaying a product launch to build up an initial inventory may be optimal and can be used as a substitute for capacity. Also, the optimal time to market and capacity increase with the coefficients of innovation and imitation in the adoption population. We compare our optimal capacity and time to market policies with those resulting from exogeneous demand forecasts in order to quantify the value of endogenizing demand.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.2.187.257","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product demand and supply dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Typically being a one-person business based at home, SOHO owners mostly rely on office information technology to single handedly run their entire operation. Despite the segment's ostensibly growing dependence and influence on the information technology (IT) industry, still very little is known about the dynamics between SOHO and IT products.

Specifically, we find that SOHO professionals' procurement choices are influenced by a number of salient dimensions (i.e., income, performance, price, interpurchase time, network externalities). Furthermore, some SOHO owners are found to have a preference for a future (expected) generation (over a currently available one), which is explained via their business dispositions (i.e., technology orientation, result orientation, search orientation) toward accepting technological incertitude.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.2.222.252","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on the technical aspects of IT adoption among SOHO professionals without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

There are a number of firms that maintain a middle ground, where some items are made to stock and others are made to order. This paper was motivated by a consumer product company faced with the decision about which items to make to stock and which ones to make to order, and the inventory and production policy for the make-to-stock items. The production environment is characterized by multiple items, setup times between the production of consecutive items, limited capacity, and congestion effects. In such an environment, making an item to order reduces inventory costs for that item, but might increase the lot size and inventory costs for the items made to stock. Also, lead times increase because of congestion effects, resulting in higher safety stocks for make-to-stock items and lower service levels for make-to-order items, thus leading to a complex trade-off. We develop a nonlinear, integer programming formulation of the problem. We present an efficient heuristic to solve the problem, which was motivated by key results for a special case of the problem without congestion effects that can be solved optimally. We also develop a lower bound to evaluate the performance of the heuristic. A computational study indicates that the heuristic performs well. We discuss the application of the model in a large firm and the resulting insights. We also provide insights into the impact of various problem parameters on the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decisions using a computational study. In particular, we find that the average number of setups of an item selected for make-to-stock production is always less than half the average number of setups of the item if it were to be made to order. Also, factors other than an item's demand, such as its setup time, processing time, and unit holding cost, impact the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decision.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.2.241.255","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and production policies without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

We argue that the \"pizza-bin\" approach of rejecting prospective technologies outright may not serve firms well when the pressure to differentiate products is enormous. After motivating the challenges and decisions facing firms using a real-life application from Dell Computer Corporation, we formulate a mathematical model of a firm that must define its products in the presence of technology uncertainty. Specifically, the firm faces two options: (i) a proven technology that is known to be viable and (ii) a prospective technology that offers superior price to performance results but whose viability is not a fully certain outcome. To minimize the impact of technology uncertainty, we consider two approaches to design flexibility, termed parallel path and sufficient design, which allow the firm to concurrently develop its products while the technology is being validated. Our analysis helps understand appropriateness of the different flexible design approaches. We illustrate our model with the Dell portable computer example and note the managerial implications of our analysis.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.3.313.7728","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technology selection and product development under uncertainty without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

The typical arrangement involves a direct exchange between two blood-type incompatible donor-candidate pairs. An alternate possibility is an indirect exchange between one such pair and the highest priority candidate on the regular waiting list for cadaveric organs. This paper focuses on the mix of direct and indirect exchanges that maximizes the expected total discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of the candidates in the participating pairs. Direct exchanges are preferable because the candidate receives a living-donor organ instead of the inferior cadaveric organ an indirect exchange provides. However, the latter involves a shorter wait. To capture this tradeoff, we develop a double-ended queueing model for an exchange system with two types of donorcandidate pairs, and obtain an optimal dynamic exchange policy by invoking a Brownian approximation. The policy takes the form of a two-sided regulator in which new pairs will join the exchange system to wait for a direct exchange if and only if the process modeling the exchange system is within the regulator's two barriers. In all other circumstances, new pairs will participate in an indirect exchange. Expressions for the optimal barriers are obtained under a variety of assumptions about the objective function, including one of complete candidate autonomy. The analysis identifies three design principles that will amplify the likelihood of an exchange program's success. First, exchange programs must involve the coordinated activities of multiple local transplant centers to enjoy the substantial benefits of resource pooling. Second, participant wait must be controlled through indirect exchanges. Third, the program must respect participants' autonomy and weigh that autonomy against the broader goal of maximizing their overall welfare.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.3.328.7732","","MS","Multidisciplinary","5","['autonomy', 'welfare', 'exchange program']","The article discusses the importance of participant autonomy and maximizing overall welfare in organ exchange programs, which reflects moderate woke themes related to ethical considerations and social impact.

The managerial challenge is to construct ex ante an appropriate NPD pipeline by choosing the right number of approaches to be funded at each stage. This so-called pipeline problem is also present in, among others, advertising copy selection and new products test markets problems. We describe here a normative model for structuring pipelines for such situations. The optimal structure of the pipeline is driven by the cost of the development approach, its probability of survival, and the expected profitability. We illustrate the workability and implications of the model by applying it to some real-world scenarios in the pharmaceutical industry, and by comparing its normative pipeline recommendations against actual pipelines. Our results suggest that, for the cases we studied, firms tend to use narrower pipelines for their new drug development than they should, and thereby they underspend on research and development.

Our contribution in the case of no carry-over, is a detailed characterization of the target intervals, assuming demands increase stochastically at the beginning of the life cycle and decrease thereafter. In the case of carry-over, we establish the general result and show that capacity and inventory are economic substitutes: The target intervals decrease in the initial stock level and the optimal unconstrained base stock level decreases in the capacity level.

Demand at the retailers is random, but stationary. Each retailer places her orders to the supplier according to the well-known (Q,R) policy. We assume that the supplier has online information about the demand, as well as inventory activities of the product at each retailer, and uses this information when making order/replenishment decisions. We first propose a replenishment policy for the supplier, which incorporates information about the inventory position of the retailers. Then, we provide an exact analysis of the operating measures of such systems. Assuming the inventory/replenishment decisions are made centrally for the system, we compare the performance of our model with those that do not use information in their decision making, namely, systems that use installation stock policies via a numerical experiment.

A self-financing portfolio is a set of long and short investments such that the sum of their investment weights, or net investment, is zero. This contrasts with a standard portfolio that has investment weights summing to one. Examples of self-financing portfolios are hedges, overlays, arbitrage portfolios, swaps, and long/short portfolios. A standard portfolio plus the IOS of self-financing portfolios form a restricted IOS hyperbola with restricted efficient set constants that differ from the usual constants. The restrictions affect statistical tests of portfolio efficiency, which are developed for the self-financing restrictions. As an application, we consider the self-financing portfolios formed by Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), based on market capitalization and value. In contrast to Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), we find that their restricted IOS is significantly different from the unrestricted IOS with the implication that the Fama-French tests are misspecified.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.3.427.7725","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investment portfolios without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We develop a theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the BOD as a strategic player, models the negotiation process between the CEO and the BOD in designing CEO compensation, and considers the impact of potential takeovers by large shareholders monitoring the CEO-BOD negotiations. In equilibrium, internal governance by the BOD and external takeover threats by a large shareholder act as substitutes in imposing managerial control, especially in constraining management's profligacy in awarding equity-based compensation to itself. The model emphasizes factors in the design of compensation contracts that are rarely considered in the literature, such as equity ownership of the largest outside shareholder and the firm's bankruptcy risk. It also provides new perspectives on factors that are often considered in the literature, such as firm size, firm performance, equity ownership of the BOD, and BOD structure. Our empirical tests lend considerable support for our theoretical predictions. Equity ownership of the largest external shareholder, that of the BOD, and the default risk, are strongly negatively related to the size of CEO equity compensation. Consistent with the theoretical model, these factors do not significantly influence the growth of fixed (or non-performance-related) compensation. We also find that the equity ownership of the BOD is more important in managerial compensation control than other BOD related variables, such as BOD size or the proportion of outside directors.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.4.453.205","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['governance', 'compensation', 'agency conflicts']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of corporate governance and managerial compensation without addressing social justice, equity, or diversity themes.

Control is defined as all attempts to motivate individuals to achieve desired objectives, and it can be exercised via formal and informal modes. Much of the previous research investigating the choice of control mode has focused on direct reporting relationships between IS project leaders and their superiors in a hierarchical setting. However, the client-IS relationships may take on a variety of forms, including both hierarchical and lateral settings. Moreover, prior research has found that the knowledge of the systems development process is a key antecedent of control, yet clients are unlikely to be as knowledgeable as IS professionals about this process. It is therefore unclear whether prior findings will generalize to the client-IS pair, and the goal of this research is to examine the exercise of control across this relationship. Data were gathered from a questionnaire survey of 69 pairs of clients and IS project leaders. The results are largely consistent with prior research on the antecedents of formal control modes, but they shed new insight on the choice of informal control modes.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.4.484.204","","MS","Multidisciplinary","3","['control', 'collaboration', 'relationships']","The article discusses the dynamics of client-IS relationships and control mechanisms, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice or progressive themes.

The average order-based backorders are the average number of customer orders that are not yet completely filled. While this is an important measure of customer satisfaction, it has not been widely studied in the operations management literature. This is largely because its evaluation involves the joint distribution of inventory levels of different items and other intricate relations, which is computationally dreadful. Taking a novel approach, this paper develops a tractable way of evaluating this measure exactly. We also develop easy-to-compute bounds, which require the evaluation of item-based backorders only. Numerical experiments indicate that the average of the lower and upper bounds is very effective. The exact results show surprisingly simple structures, which shed light on how system parameters affect the performance. Using these results, we study several examples to gain managerial insights. Questions addressed include: What are the implications of item-based inventory planning decisions on the order-based performance? What is the impact of introducing common components on inventory and service trade-offs?

We show that the production characteristics of both the bidder and the target matter in a significant way.

We find that different OTAs offer tickets with substantially different prices and characteristics when given the same customer request. Some of this variation appears to be due to product differentiation\u2014different OTAs specialize by systematically offering different trade-offs between ticket price and ticket quality (minimizing the number of connections, matching requested departure and return time). However, even after accounting for differences in ticket quality, ticket prices vary by as much as 18% across OTAs. In addition, OTAs return tickets that are strictly inferior to the ticket offered by another OTA for the same request between 2.2% and 28% of the time.

Such queues arise in remote service systems, notably the Internet and telephone call centers; hence, we refer to them as tele-queues. A basic premise of this paper is that customers adapt their patience (modeled by an abandonment-time distribution) to their service expectations, in particular to their anticipated waiting time. We present empirical support for that hypothesis, and propose an M/M/m-based model that incorporates adaptive customer behavior. In our model, customer patience depends on the mean waiting time in the queue. We characterize the resulting system equilibrium (namely, the operating point in steady state), and establish its existence and uniqueness when changes in customer patience are bounded by the corresponding changes in their anticipated waiting time. The feasibility of multiple system equilibria is illustrated when this condition is violated. Finally, a dynamic learning model is proposed where customer expectations regarding their waiting time are formed through accumulated experience. We demonstrate, via simulation, convergence to the theoretically anticipated equilibrium, while addressing certain issues related to censored-sampling that arise because of abandonments.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.4.566.211","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical modeling and analysis of customer behavior in tele-queues without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This study offers and empirically validates a procedure for (1) measuring the effect of each stage's performance on the output quality of subsequent stages including the quality of the signal product, and (2) identifying stages in a manufacturing system where management should concentrate investments in process quality improvement. Our proposed procedure builds on the precedence ordering of the stages in the system and uses the information provided by correlations between the product quality measurements across stages. The starting point of our procedure is a computer executable network representation of the statistical relationships between the product quality measurements; execution automatically converts the network to a simultaneous-equations model and estimates the model parameters by the method of least squares. The parameter estimates are used to measure and rank the impact of each stage's performance on variability in intermediate stage and final product quality. We extend our work by presenting an economic model, which uses these results, to guide management in deciding on the amount of investment in process quality improvement for each stage. We report some of the findings from an extensive empirical validation of our procedure using circuit board production line data from a major electronics manufacturer.

The probability distribution for the demand in each period is determined by the state of a Markov chain, the core process. However, the state of this core process is not directly observed, only the actual demand is observed by the decision maker. Given this demand process, the inventory control problem is a composite-state, partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), which is an appropriate model for a number of dynamic demand problems. In practice, managers often use certainty equivalent control (CEC) policies to solve such a problem. However, this paper presents results that demonstrate that there are other practical control policies that almost always provide much better solutions for this problem than the CEC policies commonly used in practice.

We support this argument by analyzing a supply chain containing a capacitated supplier and a retailer facing i.i.d. demands. In addition there are fixed ordering costs between the retailer and the supplier.In this setting, we consider two models: (1) the retailer is using the optimal (s,S) policy and providing the supplier information about her inventory levels; and (2) the retailer, still sharing information on her inventory levels, orders in a period only if by the previous period the cumulative end-customer demand since she last ordered was greater than \u03b4. Thus, in Model 1, information sharing is used to supplement existing policies; while, in Model 2, we have redefined operating policies to make better use of the information flows. We will show, via a detailed computational study, that the total supply chain costs of Model 2 are 10.4% lower, on the average, than that of Model 1. We noticed that this reduction in costs is higher at higher capacities, higher supplier penalty costs, lower retailer penalty costs, moderate values of set-up cost, and at lower end-customer demand variances.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.5.644.7806","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and cost reduction without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Production, as well as rework, is in lots requiring set-up and variable production costs, and orders need to be filled in their entirety. The yield of each stage is uncertain, so several production runs may need to be attempted until the quantity of finished products is sufficient. The trade-off at each stage is between using small lots, possibly necessitating repeated rework set-ups and large lots, which may result in costly overproduction. Multistage manufacturing facilities with rework capabilities are quite common in practice, but their optimal operation when orders have to be met in full has been virtually unexplored. We show that a multistage system where only one of the stages requires a setup (a \u201csingle-bottleneck system\u201d) can be reduced to a single-stage system. Moreover, if it is possible to arrange the operations in any order, we prove that it is best to make the \u201cbottleneck\u201d the first stage of the system.

In this paper, we present a model that captures the relationshipbetween facility layout and congestion-related measures of performance. We use the model to introduce a formulation of the facility layout design problem where the objective is to minimize work-in-process (WIP). In contrast to some recent research, we show that layouts obtained using a WIP-based formul ation can be very different from those obtained using the conventional quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation. For example, we show that a QAP-optimal layout can be WIP-infeasible. Similarly, we show that two QAP-optimal layouts can have vastly different WIP values. In general, we show that WIP is not monotonic in material-handling travel distances. This leads to a number of surprising results. For instance, we show that it is possible to reduce overall distances between departments but increase WIP. Furthermore, we find that the relative desirability of a layout can be affected by changes in material-handling capacity even when travel distances remain the same. We examine the effect of various system parameters on the difference in WIP between QAP- and WIP-optimal layouts. We find that although there are conditions under which the difference in WIP is significant, there are those under which both layouts are WIP-equivalent.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.5.679.7800","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of manufacturing strategies and facility layout design without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Forces affecting individual behavior are attitudes about payoffs (gains and losses) and beliefs about outcomes (risk and ambiguity). Under risk, the likelihoods of alternative outcomes are fully known. Under ambiguity, these likelihoods are unknown. In our experiment, payoffs and outcomes were manipulated independently during a classical choice task as brain activity was measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we show that attitudes about payoffs and beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes exhibit interaction effects both behaviorally and neurally. Participants are risk averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses; they are ambiguity-seeking in neither gains nor losses. Two neural substrates for choice surfaced in the interaction between attitudes and beliefs: a dorsomedial neocortical system and a ventromedial system. This finding reveals that the brain does not honor a prevalent assumption of economics\u2014the independence of the evaluations of payoffs and outcomes. The demonstration of a relationship between brain activity and observed economic choice attests to the feasibility of a neuroeconomic decision science.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.6.711.194","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on economic behavior and neural substrates without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We explore these differences by comparing customers who utilize personal-computer-based home banking (PC banking) to other bank customers. Case studies and detailed customer data from four institutions suggest that PC banking customers are apparently more profitable, principally due to unobservable characteristics extant before the adoption of PC banking. Demographic characteristics and changes in customer behavior following adoption of PC banking account for only a small fraction of overall differences.

Instead, the proposed technique gives responses in the form of a number plus a guarantee so that the user can determine an interval that is sure to contain the exact answer. At the same time, the method is also able to provide both deterministic and stochastic protection of the confidential data to the subjects of the database. Insider threat is defined precisely and a simple option for defense against it is given. Computational results on a simulated database are very encouraging in that most queries are answered with tight intervals, and that the quality of the responses improves with the number of subjects identified by the query. Thus the results are very appropriate for the very large databases prevalent in business and governmental organizations.

A common communication strategy to break through this competitive clutter is to increase ad originality. However, ad originality may have detrimental effects when consumers pay more attention to the ad at the expense of the advertised brand. Moreover, the positive effects of originality may quickly wane when the ad becomes familiar. Surprisingly, no research to date has examined such brand attention and memory effects of ad originality and familiarity. The current study aims to fill this void. We use a stochastic model of the influence that ad originality and familiarity have on consumers' eye fixations to the key elements of advertisements\u2014brand, text, and pictorial\u2014and how the information extracted during eye fixations promotes memory for the advertised brand. The model explicitly accounts for heterogeneity due to consumers and advertisements. Infrared eye tracking was applied to collect eye fixation data from 119 consumers who paged through two general-audience magazines containing 58 full-page advertisements. Memory for the advertised brands was assessed with an indirect memory task. The model was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In support of our hypotheses, original advertisements drew more attention to the advertised brand. More importantly however, advertisements that were both original and familiar attracted the largest amount of attention to the advertised brand, which improved subsequent brand memory. In addition, original and familiar ads were found to promote brand memory directly. Implications of these findings for communication and media planning strategy are discussed.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.6.765.192","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of advertising effectiveness without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

These studies, however, almost invariably focus on the role of firm or external ownership characteristics in predicting R&D spending while overlooking the attributes of the top managers involved in allocating corporate resources. In this study, we change that focus by empirically examining how R&D spending as compared to industry competitors varies at firms based on the characteristics of their CEOs. Using a sample of publicly traded firms, we find that CEO characteristics explain a significant proportion of the sample variance in firm R&D spending even when corporate strategy, ownership structure, and other firm-level attributes are controlled. In terms of individual CEO characteristics, we find that R&D spending is greater at firms where CEOs are younger, have greater wealth invested in firm stock and signifacant career experience in marketing and/or engineering/R&D. In contrast to existing theory, we find that the amount of a CEO's formal education had no significant association with R&D spending once a CEO has attained a college degree. However, significant R&D spending increases are found at firms where CEOs have advanced science-related degrees. From subgroup analyses, we further find that CEO effects on relative R&D spending increase with longer CEO tenure implying that CEOs, over time, may mold R&D spending to suit their own preferences. From these results, we make implications for both research on determinants of R&D spending and managerial practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.6.782.187","","MS","Multidisciplinary","2","['CEO characteristics', 'R&D spending', 'corporate resources']","The article primarily focuses on the relationship between CEO characteristics and R&D spending, lacking any significant emphasis on social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

The results of the study reveal a contingency relationship among product competitive strategies, purchasing design characteristics, and overall firm financial performance (return on assets). Specifically, the nature of this contingency relationship suggests that a firm's product competitive strategy must be enabled with a complementary design in purchasing management to promote firm performance. Given the growing practice of benchmarking at the functional level, this study also examines whether or not a firm achieving a congruency in product strategy and design will necessarily enjoy higher operational efficiency at the purchasing management level.

The real option in our model is a timing option. The agents have limited capacity to undertake projects, and each agent's capacity can be filled now or later. Because the principal cares about capacity in the aggregate but each agent cares only about his own capacity, the agents assign a higher value to the option to wait. As a result, agents sometimes withhold ideas from the principal. We show that decentralization can be a solution to this problem. Delegating assignment rights to an agent reduces the option value of waiting for the other agent sufficiently that he is willing to reveal his ideas.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.7.886.2822","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical incentive problem between a principal and agents without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, in complex systems, decision makers may not always have a precise understanding of the exact strength of the interaction between activities. Likewise, incentive and accounting systems may lead decision makers to ignore or misperceive interactions. This paper studies formally the consequences of misperceiving interaction effects between activity choices. Our results suggest that misperceptions with respect to complements are more costly than with respect to substitutes. As a result, firms should optimally invest more to gather information about interactions among complementary activities\u2014e.g., concerning network effects\u2014than about interactions among substitute activities. Similarly, the use of division-based incentive schemes appears to be more advisable for divisions whose products are substitutes than for divisions that produce complements. It is further shown that system fragility is not necessarily positively correlated with the strength ofthe interaction between choices. While systems of complements become increasingly fragile as the strength of interaction increases, systems of substitutes can become increasingly stable.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.7.900.2820","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of decision-making and competitive advantage without any mention of social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Second, based on this result, we derive a recursive integral equation for the exercise boundary and provide a parametric representation of the American option price.

Our three specific objectives include first critiquing the IPD literature by identifying problems with empirical research and recommending solutions. There are concerns about the overall approach, conceptualizing and operationalizing IPD characteristics, and selecting performance objectives. Second, we conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate relationships between specific IPD characteristics and project performance. We indicate where relationships do or do not exist and identify variables that may moderate these relationships.

A causal mapping, which may be incompletely known by the project team, represents the impact of possible actions on the states of the world. An underlying probability space represents available information about the state of the world. Interactions among actions and states of the world determine the complexity of the payoff function. Activities are endogenous, in that they are the result of a policy that maximizes the expected project payoff. A key concept is the adequacy of the available information about states of the world and action effects. We express uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity in terms of information adequacy. We identify three fundamental project management strategies: instructionism, learning, and selectionism. We show that classic project management methods emphasize adequate information and instructionism, and demonstrate how modern methods fit into the three fundamental strategies. The appropriate strategy is contingent on the type of uncertainty present and the complexity of the project payoff function. Our model establishes a rigorous language that allows the project manager to judge the adequacy of the available project information at the outset, choose an appropriate combination of strategies, and set a supporting project infrastructure\u2014that is, systems for planning, coordination and incentives, and monitoring.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1008.163","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of project management, emphasizing uncertainty and complexity without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our fundamental idea is that sales in new markets are initially low because the first commercialized forms of new innovations are primitive. Then, as new firms enter, actual and perceived product quality improves (and prices possibly drop), which leads to a takeoff in sales. To provide empirical evidence for this explanation, we explore the relationship between takeoff times, price decreases, and firm entry for a sample of consumer and industrial product innovations commercialized in the United States over the past 150 years. Based on a proportional hazards analysis of takeoff times, we find that new firm entry dominates other factors in explaining observed sales takeoff times. We interpret these results as supporting the idea that demand shifts during the early evolution of a new market due to nonprice factors is the key driver of a sales takeoff.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1024.167","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on market dynamics and sales takeoff without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

A fundamental premise of this perspective is that all parties can be weakly better off if they work together to increase joint surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. For marketing managers, this implies organizing marketing activities in a manner that maximizes total surplus. This logic is theoretically sound when agreements between partners are limitless and costless. In most consumer marketing contexts (business-to-consumer), this is typically not true. The question I ask is should one still expect firms to partner with consumers and reach Pareto-efficient agreements? In this paper, I use the example of a firm's choice of product configuration to demonstrate two effects. First, I show that a firm may configure a product in a manner that reduces total surplus but increases firm profits. Second, one might conjecture that increased competition would eliminate this effect, but I show that in a duopoly firm profits may be increasing in the cost of product completion. This second result suggests that firms may prefer to remain inefficient and/or stifie innovations. Both results violate a fundamental premise of partnering\u2014that firms and consumers should work together to increase total surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. The model illustrates that Pareto-efficient agreements are less likely to occur if negotiation with individual partners is infeasible or costly, such as in business-to\u2013consumer contexts. Consumer marketers in one-to- many marketing environments should be wary of treating customers as partners because Pareto\u2013efficient agreements may not be optimal for their firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.8.955.170","","MS","Multidisciplinary","4","['partnership', 'surplus', 'inefficiency', 'consumer', 'profits']","The article discusses the concept of treating customers as partners, which touches on collaborative business practices and the implications of profit versus collective benefit.

However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects.We find that the EWA learning model tracks the investment decisions of our subjects well, whether we hold out trials or an entire group of subjects.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.8.972.165","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on mixed-strategy games and their implications in competitive environments without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Two common forms of channel rebates are linear rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold, and target rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold beyond a specified target level. When demand is not influenced by sales effort, a properly designed target rebate achieves channel coordination and a win-win outcome. Coordination cannot be achieved by a linear rebate in a way that is implementable. When demand is influenced by retailer sales effort, a properly designed target rebate and returns contract achieves coordination and a win-win outcome.

We develop scales to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types. We show that innovations can be evaluated distinctively on these various dimensions with generally small correlations between them. We estimate the impact these different innovation characteristics and types have on time to introduction and perceived commercial success.

Online vendors have traditionally charged users for information on the based on the length of the time they were connected to the databases. With hardware and software advances, many online servers have recently started changing their pricing strategies to search-based and/or subscription-fee pricing. This paper examines the various issues involved in pricing these information products, and presents an economic approach to analyze conditions under which the various pricing schemes may prove optimal for the online servers. Our results show that the variation in consumer expertise and valuation of information affects the choice of a pricing strategy by the server. We present general conditions under which subscription-fee pricing is optimal even when consumer demand is inelastic. We also find that, given the cost structures characterizing the market, undifferentiated online servers can compete and coexist in the market each making positive profits. We show that in a competitive setting an increase in costs of online servers can sometimes benefit them by enabling them to differentiate themselves. Our results offer insights into the trends in pricing strategies and may provide an explanation as to why many servers may persist with connect-time strategies.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.9.1123.178","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses primarily on technical aspects of pricing strategies for online information servers without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We explore the competitive effects of one-to-one promotions in a model with two competing firms where the firms differ in size and consumers have heterogeneous brand loyalty. We find that one-to-one promotions always lead to an increase in price competition (average prices in the market decrease). However, we also find that one-to-one promotions affect market shares. This market-share effect may outweigh the effect of lower prices, benefiting the firm whose market share increases. Our results suggest that of two firms, the firm with the higher-quality product may gain from one-to-one promotions. Our model also has implications for the phenomenon of customer churn, where consumers switch to a less preferred brand due to targeted promotional incentives. We show that churning can arise optimally from firms pursuing a profit-maximizing strategy. Instead of trying to minimize it, the optimal way to manage customer churn is to engage in both offensive and defensive promotions with the relative mix depending on the marginal cost of targeting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.9.1143.172","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on competitive pricing strategies and market dynamics without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

However, other research has pointed out the limitations of these studies and found evidence that many pioneers fail or have low market share. Given this background, the purpose of this research is to understand the conditions under which pioneers are more likely and also less likely to have an advantage. We propose a game-theoretic model that includes important sources of pioneer advantages as well as disadvantages. Specifically, we incorporate a pioneer advantage due to preemption in markets with heterogeneous tastes. In addition, we incorporate a potential pioneer disadvantage due to technology vintage effects, where later entrants utilizing improved technology can have lower costs and higher quality. The model allows us to evaluate the extent of vintage effects necessary to overcome a pioneer's advantage. Key relationships are found between the magnitude of the pioneer advantage or disadvantage and consumer valuations of product attributes (e.g., variety and quality). We empirically validate the model with vintage effect data in 36 product categories, and measures of consumer valuations of product variety and quality for 12 of these 36 categories. The results show that pioneers do better in product categories where variety is more important and worse in categories where product quality is more important. Pioneers in categories with high vintage effects are shown to have lower market shares and higher failure rates. Similar results appear when analyzing persistence of market leadership over time, further validating our model's major implications. We also present two case studies that illustrate key elements of the model.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.9.1175.175","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article primarily focuses on market dynamics and consumer valuations without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.

The retailers are engaged in a Cournot competition and are endowed with some private information. Vertical information sharing has two effects: \"direct effect\" due to the changes in strategy by the parties involved in sharing the information and \"indirect effect\" (or \"leakage effect\") due to the changes in strategy by other competing firms (who may infer the information from the actions of the informed parties). Both changes would affect the profitability of the firms. We show that the leakage effect discourages the retailers from sharing their demand information with the manufacturer while encouraging them to share their cost information. On the other hand, the direct effect always discourages the retailers from sharing their information. When voluntary information sharing is not possible, we identify conditions under which information can be traded and show how price should be determined to facilitate such information exchange.

Using single-parameter functional representations of the skewness of unit costs and average demand across all parts in the system, simple approximate analytical expressions for the required inventory investment are derived for both approaches. The accuracy of the approximations is validated using data from a distribution center for computer spare parts. For these data, the solutions obtained by the approximations are very close to the exact values. The results show that inventory investments can be well approximated as a function of only a few cost and demand parameters. These expressions can be used to determine the percentage reduction in inventory investment for a particular target demand-weighted average fill rate when the superior system approach is used instead of the item approach. For increased ease of use, the percentage reduction in inventory when using a system as opposed to an item approach is computed over a range of realistic values for the key parameters of the model and a quadratic expression is fitted to the data. This fitted expression provides rough guidelines for the anticipated improvement with very limited data needed, prior to detailed modeling or implementation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.9.1213.173","","MS","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical inventory management models and does not address any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

As in many practical settings, the supply chain members progressively observe market signals that enable them to explain future demand. The demand itself evolves according to an auto-regressive time series. We examine three types of supply chain configurations. In the first setting, the retailer and the supplier coordinate their policy parameters in an attempt to minimize systemwide costs, but they do not share their observations of market signals. In the second setting, resembling many original vendor-managed inventory (VMI) programs, the supplier takes the full responsibility of managing the supply chain's inventory, but the retailer's observations of market signals are not transferred to him. In our third setting, reminiscent of collaborative forecasting and replenishment partnerships, inventory is managed centrally, and all demand related information is shared. We propose a set of stylized models to study the three settings and use them to provide managerial insights into the value of information sharing, VMI, and collaborative forecasting.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.4.1.55.285","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and does not address any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations.

The retailers replenish their stock from the warehouse, which in turn places orders at an outside supplier with infinite capacity. Transportation times and costs are constant. No ordering costs are considered, but warehouse replenishments must be multiples of a given batch quantity. The objective is to find policies that minimize holding and backorder costs. The standard approach to approximately solve this problem is to use a \u201cbalance\u201d assumption, meaning that negative stock allocations to the retailers are possible. This approach may lead to considerable errors for problems with large differences between the retailers in terms of service requirements and demand characteristics. To handle such situations we suggest and evaluate two computationally tractable heuristics: the Virtual Assignment ordering rule for warehouse replenishments and the Two-step Allocation rule for allocating stock from the warehouse to the retailers. Numerical evidence shows that, especially when combining these heuristics, we obtain considerable improvements for many problems over the standard approach. Savings of up to 50% have been recorded.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.4.1.75.291","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, resulting in a score of 1."],["2002","4","2","Feng ChengFeng Chengfcheng(us.ibm.comIBM Research Division, T.J.

In fact, CTO has made irrelevant the notion of preconfigured machine types and focuses instead on maintaining the right amount of inventory at the components. CTO appears to be the ideal operational model that provides both mass customization and a quick response time to order fulfillment. To quantify the inventory-service trade-off in the CTO environment, we develop a nonlinear optimization model with multiple constraints, reflecting the service levels offered to different market segments. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an exact algorithm for the important case of demand in each market segment having (at least) one unique component, and a greedy heuristic for the general (nonunique component) case. Furthermore, we show how to use sensitivity analysis, along with simulation, to fine-tune the solutions. The performance of the model and the solution approach is examined by extensive numerical studies on realistic problem data. We present the major findings in applying our model to study the inventory-service impacts in the reengineering of a PC manufacturing process.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.4.2.114.282","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization in manufacturing processes without any reference to social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We consider a Bayesian model of demand in which the unknown mean demand rate is assumed to have a prior, which is a mixture of two normal distributions corresponding to the demand forecast for an innovative (fashion) good. We develop three models of production flexibility: a static model requiring initial placement of both orders, a partially dynamic model requiring a fixing of the time that the second order will be made, and a fully dynamic model with no restrictions on ordering. Supplier flexibility is modeled through supply lead times. We observe that the magnitude of the savings from the static to the fully flexible model, corresponding to the sum of the values of information and production flexibility, reflects all sources of variability: differences between demand means of the prior mixture, variability within each prior, and variability about the observed mean. We observe that as the difference between high and low demand cases increases, the value of information increases, though for long lead times, production flexibility is required to take advantage of the updated information. Further, we observe that the greater the uncertainty within each prior distribution, the greater the value of information relative to the value of production flexibility, particularly for long lead times. However, the greater the uncertainty around the mean demand, which is the uncertainty that cannot be resolved through observation, the lower the value of information. Finally, we observe that the value of supply flexibility grows initially in a concave then convex manner as a function of the supply lead times.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.4.2.99.283","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of demand information and production flexibility without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Specifically using a two-period model with correlated demand, we illustrate how options provide flexibility to a buyer to respond to market changes in the second period. We also study the implications of such arrangements between a buyer and a supplier for coordination of the channel. We show that, in general, channel coordination can be achieved only if we allow the exercise price to be piecewise linear. We develop sufficient conditions on the cost parameters such that linear prices coordinate the channel. We derive the appropriate prices for channel coordination which, however, violate the individual rationality constraint for the supplier. Contrary to popular belief (based on simpler models) we show that credit for returns offered by the supplier does not always coordinate the channel and alleviate the individual rationality constraint. Credit for returns are useful only on a subset of the feasibility region under which channel coordination is achievable with linear prices. Finally, we demonstrate (numerically) the benefits of options in improving channel performance and evaluate the magnitude of loss due to lack of coordination.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.4.3.171.7754","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply contracts and channel coordination without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In a large organization production and marketing are traditionally measured in terms of performance criteria appropriate and relevant within the world in which they operate, rather than in terms of overall company performance. We consider a situation where the headquarters uses a simple linear transfer price between the two functions to govern the transactions. The misaligned incentives among these functional managers are caused by a transfer price between them that distorts the marginal production cost and revenue, as well as by a misallocation of cost: Marketing's pricing strategy influences expected leftover inventory, but only production incurs the cost. The misalignment can be mitigated through the following two ways. First, if production commits to a service level instead of an inventory level, both production and marketing, and hence the firm as a whole, are better off. Second, the same improvement can be achieved through organizational changes so that marketing becomes the dominant function. We also propose a mechanism that aligns the functional managers' incentives to be compatible to the firm.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.4.4.241.5729","","MSOM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on operational strategies related to pricing and replenishment without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This discretion in choice is captured through alternate or \u201cnonbasic\u201d activities that can redeploy inputs and resources to best respond to resolved uncertain events.

In this policy, the cache is filled with documents based upon a document's \u201cage,\u201d defined as the time elapsed since the document was last accessed. The user's preference for a document is modeled as a general function that declines with the document's age.

Unlike many previous studies that evaluate caching policies using simulation methods, this study derives analytical expressions to evaluate performance. The study also presents an approximate, easy-to-compute method to evaluate performance. Numerical tests show this approximation to be extremely accurate. A variety of other numerical results are presented that help describe the behavior ofthe LRU policy under different situations (e.g., when the documents need to be updated periodically). We also compare the LRU policy with other caching policies (both static and dynamic) for small problems.

We introduce convex and, in particular semidefinite optimization methods, duality, and complexity theory to shed new light on this relation. For the single stock problem, given moments of the prices of the underlying assets, we show that we can find best-possible bounds on option prices with general payoff functions efficiently, either algorithmically (solving a semidefinite optimization problem) or in closed form. Conversely, given observable option prices, we provide best-possible bounds on moments of the prices of the underlying assets, as well as on the prices of other options on the same asset by solving linear optimization problems. For options that are affected by multiple stocks either directly (the payoff of the option depends on multiple stocks) or indirectly (we have information on correlations between stock prices), we find nonoptimal bounds using convex optimization methods. However, we show that it is NP-hard to find best possible bounds in multiple dimensions.

The problem is formulated as a two-stage, single-period stochastic program. The firm invests in capacity before the actual demand is known and optimally assigns capacity to customers when demand is realized. Sample applications include a car rental company's use of mid-sized cars to satisfy unexpectedly high demand for compact cars and an airline's use of business-class seats to satisfy economy-class demand. We obtain an analytical solution for a particular case, when services may be upgraded by one class. The simple form of the solution allows us to compare the optimal capacities explicitly with a solution that does not anticipate flexibility. Given that demand follows a multivariate normal distribution, we analytically characterize the effects of increasing demand correlation on the optimal solution. For the case with two customer classes, the effects of demand correlation are intuitive: Increasing correlation induces a shift from flexible to dedicated capacity. When there are three or more classes, there are also adjustments to the resources not directly affected by the correlation change. As correlation rises, these changes follow an alternating pattern (for example, if the optimal capacity of one resource rises, then the optimal capacity of the adjacent resource falls). These results make precise conjectures based on numerical experiments that have existed in the literature for some time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.2.375.428","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of service capacity and demand correlation without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Strategies to cope with these risks are typically dynamic. Sequential decision making is one of the most important ways to cope with risk due to uncertain rainfall. In this paper, a stochastic programming model is presented to describe farmers' sequential decisions in reaction to rainfall. The model describes farmers' strategies of production, consumption, selling, purchasing, and storage from the start of the growing season until one year after the harvest period. This dynamic model better describes farmers' strategies than do static models that are usually applied.

This implies that the level of demand at each customer is not known before arriving at the customer. In some cases, the vehicle may thus be unable to load the customer's demand, even ifthe expected demand along the route does not exceed the vehicle capacity. Such a situation is referred to as a failure. The capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (SVRP) then consists ofminimizing the total cost ofthe planned routes and of expected failures. Here, penalties for failures correspond to return trips to the depot. The vehicle first returns to the depot to unload, then resumes its trip as originally planned. This article studies an implementation of the Integer L-shaped method for the exact solution of the SVRP. It develops new lower bounds on the expected penalty for failures. In addition, it provides variants of the optimality cuts for the SVRP that also hold at fractional solutions. Numerical experiments indicate that some instances involving up to 100 customers and few vehicles can be solved to optimality within a relatively short computing time.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.3.415.7751","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on a technical optimization problem related to vehicle routing without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

Production is performed in \u201clots\u201d that require costly setup, and output quality is stochastic. The size of each lot must be set before output quality is observed. We study production processes whose yield is distributed according to a generalized truncated geometric distribution: Production can randomly go \u201cout of control,\u201d in which case all subsequent output of that lot is defective. The \u201cgeneralization\u201d allows both hazard rates and marginal production costs to vary as production progresses. Our results characterize the optimal lot sizes. In particular, we show that for small demands the optimal lot size equals the outstanding demand, and for larger demands it is less than the outstanding demand, with all lot sizes being uniformly bounded. For sufficiently large demands, we identify conditions under which the optimal lots are precisely those that minimize the ratio of production cost to the expected number of good items. A tighter characterization is given for the standard case, where hazard rates and marginal costs are constant.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.3.424.7743","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production processes and optimization without any reference to social issues, diversity, or ethical considerations.

There exists no global optimization algorithm that has been developed and tested for this class of problems, aside from a total enumeration approach. Beginning with the Euclidean distance problem, we design a branch-and-bound algorithm based on a partitioning of the allocation space that finitely converges to a global optimum for this nonconvex problem. For deriving lower bounds at node subproblems in this partial enumeration scheme, we employ two types of procedures. The first approach computes a lower bound via a projected location space subproblem. The second approach derives a significantly enhanced lower bound by using a Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) to transform an equivalent representation of the original nonconvex problem into a higher dimensional linear programming relaxation. In addition, certain cut-set inequalities are generated in the allocation space, and objective function based cuts are derived in the location space to further tighten the lower bounding relaxation. The RLT procedure is then extended to the general lp distance problem, for p > 1. Computational experience is provided on a set of test problems to investigate both the projected location space and the RLT-lower bounding schemes. The results indicate that the proposed global optimization approach using the RLT-based scheme offers a promising viable solution procedure. In fact, among the problems solved, for the only two test instances available in the literature for the Euclidean distance case, we report significantly improved solutions.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.3.433.7739","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical optimization algorithms without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or social justice issues.

Unfortunately, multistage stochastic programming (SP) models for portfolio selection very quickly become intractable as assumptions are relaxed and uncertainty is introduced. In this paper, I present an alternative model framework for portfolio selection, stochastic convergence (SC), that systematically incorporates uncertainty under a realistic assumption set. The optimal portfolio is derived through an iterative procedure, where portfolio plans are evaluated under many possible future scenarios then revised until the model converges to the optimal plan. This approach allows for scenario analysis over all stochastic components, requires no limitation on the structural form of the objective or constraints, and permits evaluation over any length planning horizon while maintaining model tractability by aggregating the scenario tree at each stage in the solution process. Through focused aggregation schemes, the SC approach allows for the implementation of a lower partial variance riskmetric, which is preferred in investment selection. In simulated tests, the SC model, with scenario aggregation, generated portfolios exhibiting performance similar to those generated using the SP model form with no aggregation. Empirical tests using historical fund returns show that a multiperiod SC decision strategy outperforms various benchmarkstrate gies over a long-term test horizon under both asset-liability matching and return maximization frameworks.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.3.462.7738","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of portfolio selection and does not address any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In order to apply this approach in practice, it may be necessary to approximate the supply functions of other players. We derive bounds on the loss in revenue that occurs in comparison with the exact supply function response, when a generator uses an approximation both for its own supply function and for the supply functions of other players.

However, net present value is rarely used in production and inventory decisions. The main reasons appear to be the complexity of the formulae and the robustness of the EOQ model. We investigate the general multiproduct, multistage production and inventory model using the net present value of its total cost as the objective function. A power-of-two heuristic gives us a near optimal solution to this problem. If the base period is fixed (or varied), the solution based on the best power-of-two heuristic will be within 6.2% (or 2.1% ) of the optimal. This result is surprisingly similar to models using the long-term average cost. The average cost does not reflect the time value of money. Does this mean that decisions based on average cost are significantly inferior to those based on net present value? The answer is quite surprising. If we include discounted production cost in the holding cost, it turns out that the decision based on average cost is only 9.6% (in terms of the net present value of the total cost) worse than the decision based on the net present value. However, the reorder interval based on the average cost could be much longer than that derived using net present value. This result shows that average cost is a good approximation to the net present value when the demands are deterministic.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.3.528.7744","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of production and inventory modeling using net present value without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

In this context, we demonstrate the dynamic use of an exact solution technique within ART. The generalizability of the proposed solution methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a second problem, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Computational results are presented for both the HFC network design problem and the TSP, indicating high-quality solutions expending a very modest computational effort. The proposed solution method is found to be effective, and is shown to be easily adaptable to new problems without much crafting, and as such, has a broad appeal to the general operations research community.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.3.538.7737","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of network design and efficiency without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

We prove the existence of a solution of the optimization problem and describe a competitive market economy that implements the solution and satisfies the informational constraints imposed by the nature of the decentralized resource allocation problem. The economy consists of four different types of agents: resource providers, service providers, users, and an auctioneer that regulates the prices based on the observed aggregate excess demand. The goods that are sold are: (i) the resources at each link of the network, and (ii) services constructed from these resources and then delivered to users.

The MTZ constraints yield a compact representation for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and their use is particularly attractive in various routing and scheduling contexts that have an embedded ATSP structure. However, it is well recognized that these constraints yield weak relaxations, and with this motivation, Desrochers and Laporte (1991) have lifted the MTZ constraints into facets of the underlying ATSP polytope. We show that a novel application of the RLT process from a nonstandard MTZ representation of the ATSP reveals a new formulation of this problem that is compact, and yet theoretically as well as computationally dominates the lifted-MTZ formulation of Desrochers and Laporte. This approach is also extended to derive tight formulations for the Precedence Constrained Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (PCATSP), based on the MTZ subtour elimination constraints. Additional classes of valid inequalities are also developed for both these versions of the ATSP, and further ideas for developing tighter representations are suggested for future investigations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.4.656.2865","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of optimization and problem-solving in operations research without any mention of social themes, diversity, or ethical considerations."],["2002","50","4","Kathrin KlamrothKathrin KlamrothInstitute of Applied Mathematics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, GermanySearch for more papers by this author, Margaret M.

We also show similar asymptotic results for expected revenues. In addition, we describe counterintuitive behavior that can occur when allocations are updated during the booking process (updating allocations can lead to lower expected revenue).

In this paper we have focused on analyzing the marginal role of a given variable, called candidate, with respect to the efficiency measured by means of a DEA model. First, we have defined a new efficiency contribution measure (ECM), which finally compares the efficiency scores of the two radial DEA models differing in the candidate. This can be either one input or one output. Then,based on ECM, we have also approached the problem from a statistical point of view. To be precise, we have developed a statistical test that allows us to evaluate the significance of the observed efficiency contribution of the candidate. Eventually, solving this test may provide some useful insights in order to decide the incorporation or the deletion of a variable into/from a given DEA model, on the basis of the information supplied by the data. Two procedures for progressive selection of variables were designed by sequentially applying the test: a forward selection and a backward elimination.

Achieving the process improvements necessary for pollution prevention is challenging due to the inherent complexity and unpredictability of several types of processes found in the food processing, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and specialty chemical industries. We propose an iterative procedure to achieve process improvements through model-based process redesign. This procedure is based on successive convex approximations of the process performance model, where product flows and process settings are optimized for a given configuration and the solution and dual variables of this optimization problem are used to update the process configuration following a greedy capacity reallocation procedure. We implemented this procedure over a five-year period at Cerestar, a major European producer of starch products, which led to a dramatic simplification in process configuration. Reduced energy and water consumption led to an estimated $3 million annual cost savings. Moreover, the reduction in environmental impacts allowed Cerestar to maintain current production levels without investing $100 million in additional wastewater treatment capacity to comply with new environmental constraints.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.5.751","","OR","Multidisciplinary","5","['environmental', 'pollution prevention', 'sustainability']","The article discusses environmental constraints and pollution prevention, indicating a moderate focus on sustainability and ethical considerations in industrial processes.

The common characteristic of those charts is that one or more of the chart parameters (sampling interval, sample size,control limits) is allowed to change during operation, taking into account current sample information. Due to their flexibility, adaptive charts are more effective than their static counterparts but they are also more complex in terms of implementation. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the economic performance of various adaptive control schemes to derive conclusions about their relative effectiveness. The analysis concentrates on Bayesian control charts used for monitoring the process mean in finite production runs. We present dynamic programming formulations and properties of the optimal solutions, which we then use to solve a number of numerical examples. The results from our comparative numerical study indicate that the chart parameter having the most positive impact on the economic performance by being adaptive is the sampling interval. It is therefore sufficient in most cases to use control charts with adaptive sampling intervals rather than other types of partially adaptive charts or the more complicated fully adaptive control charts.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.5.878.361","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of statistical process control and economic performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

For any given base-stock policy, the exact performance analysis reduces to the evaluation of a set of M/G/\u221e queues with a common arrival stream. We show that unlike the standard M/G/\u221e queueing system, lead time (service time) variability degrades performance in this assembly system. We also show that it is desirable to keep higher base-stock levels for components with longer mean lead times (and lower unit costs). We derive easy-to-compute performance bounds and use them as surrogates for the performance measures in several optimization problems that seek the best trade-off between inventory and customer service.

Stochastic programming is a major tool developed to deal with optimization with uncertainties which has found applications in, e.g., finance, such as asset\u2013liability and bond\u2013portfolio management. Computationally, however, many models in stochastic programming remain unsolvable because of overwhelming dimensionality. For a model to be well solvable, its special structure must be explored. Most of the solution methods are based on decomposing the data. In this paper we propose a new decomposition approach for two-stage stochastic programming, based on a direct application of the path-following method combined with the homogeneous self-dual technique. Numerical experiments show that our decomposition algorithm is very efficient for solving stochastic programs. In particular, we apply our decomposition method to a two-period portfolio selection problem using options on a stock index. In this model the investor can invest in a money-market account, a stock index, and European options on this index with different maturities. We experiment with our model with market prices of options on the S&P500.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.50.5.904.360","","OR","Multidisciplinary","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stochastic programming and optimization without any mention of social issues, ethics, or diversity.

In particular, we demonstrate that there exists a zero-inventory-ordering(ZIO) policy, i.e., a policy in which an order is placed only when the inventory level drops to zero, whose total inventory and ordering cost is no more than 4/3 times the optimal cost. Furthermore, if the ordering cost function does not vary over time, then the cost of the best ZIO policy is no more than 5.6/4.6 times the optimal cost. These results hold for any transportation and holding cost functions that satisfy the following properties: (i) they are non decreasing functions, and (ii) the associated cost per unit is non increasing.

A component is then used to produce a set of belts with the same girth; but, if necessary, the girth required can also be obtained by sewing together two components. The major objectives of optimisation are: trim loss minimisation, quality control, workload equalisation, setup minimisation. The problem, a particular one-dimensional cutting stock with both cutting and reuse decision variables, has been formulated in terms of integer linear programming and then efficiently solved by applying standard packages within a column generation scheme.

Moreover, it indicates the asymptotic capacity of a system. Such a curve is used to characterize system performance over a range of start rates. Simulation is a fundamental method for generating such curves since simulation can handle the complexity of real systems with acceptable precision and accuracy. A simulation-based cycle time-throughput curve requires a large amount of simulation output data; the precision and accuracy of a simulated curve may be poor if there is insufficient simulation data. To overcome these problems, sequential simulation experiments based on a nonlinear D-optimal design are suggested. Using the nonlinear shape of the curve, such a design pinpoints p starting design points, and then sequentially ranks the remaining n \u2013 p candidate design points, where n is the total number of possible design points being considered.

Analysis of data from 167 MNE subunits in the People's Republic of China suggests that capability exploitation and capability building are inversely associated with environmental complexity and industrial uncertainty. Business cultural specificity impedes capability exploitation but not capability building. While capability exploitation is associated with the use of wholly owned entry mode, capability building is linked to the joint venture mode.

We argue that a powerful implicit assumption within the stakeholder literature\u2014that priorities within role-based stakeholder groups are relatively homogeneous\u2014blurs our understanding of organization-stakeholder relationships. Two important and related areas of concern are presented. The first involves the primacy of role in stakeholder definition. This role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is appropriate if, for a particular issue, role-based stakeholder group members have similar priorities. Individual and collective self-interest provides a rationale for this assumption. However, an important problem with this approach arises in situations in which self-interest is not the primary motivator of individuals' priorities. In these instances, subgroups within different role-based stakeholder groups might have more similar priorities than either subgroup has with others within their role-based stakeholder group. In these situations the role primacy approach impedes, rather than facilitates, an understanding of our environment. Our second concern is related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall short in the determination of relevant interests and the subsequent subdivision of role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined specific stakeholder groups. Having suggested that the role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is less than ideal, we examine the extent to which, and the conditions under which, roles are likely to determine priorities, and thus, the likelihood of relatively homogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. In addition, we present an illustrative empirical analysis of stakeholder group priorities. The illustrative study is conducted within the context of intercollegiate athletics. Related literature and our empirical results indicate that role-based self-interest frequently is not a sufficient \"binding tie\" of stakeholder groups. Given this background, we present an alternative approach to stakeholder analysis that borrows heavily from the customer segmentation literature of marketing. Our alternative approach can accommodate heterogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.1.64.544","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['stakeholder management', 'self-interest', 'priorities', 'heterogeneous', 'analysis']","The article discusses stakeholder management and the importance of recognizing diverse priorities within stakeholder groups, indicating a moderate focus on DEI themes.

However, few prior empirical studies have directly and systematically documented the incidence or prevalence of persistent superior economic performance. The research reported here is based on empirical studies of a large number of industry samples for which longitudinal data were stratified by levels of performance using a new methodology and then analyzed in terms of their dynamics. This new stratification technique was used in lieu of autoregressive methods employed in prior studies of performance persistence to allow for a true outlier analysis because persistent superior economic performance both has been argued theoretically, and found empirically, to be rare. Detailed results from a sample of 6,772 firms in 40 industries over 25 years are presented to illustrate the findings that: (1) while some firms do exhibit superior economic performance, (2) only a very small minority do so, and (3) the phenomenon very rarely persists for long time frames. These results, while not providing direct support for a particular extant strategic management or economic theory concerning firm performance, are most consonant with the resource-based view of the firm and have implications for significant aspects of other received strategic management and economic theories.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.1.81.542","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses solely on competitive advantage and economic performance without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Data were collected through 73 interviews, a questionnaire, and numerous documents. Four main findings emerged from the case studies. First, IT was found to facilitate organizational downsizing, but not to cause it. New City invested heavily in state-of-the-art IT over the years and more successfully downsized the organization than Old City, which lagged behind in IT investment and made no serious attempts to use IT as a tool to support strategic actions. Second, adverse environmental conditions triggered downsizing in both cities and determined the change strategies that managers used. When environmental pressures were mild (1985-1990), managers favored a convergent change strategy that resulted in limited downsizing efforts and small personnel reductions. In contrast, when environmental pressures were strong (1990-1995), managers of both cities engaged in strategic reorientation and in downsizing efforts that led to larger personnel reductions. Third, the role IT played in organizational downsizing varied according to the change strategy. IT was used to facilitate work redesign in a convergent change strategy and to facilitate more significant structural and work redesign in strategic reorientation. Fourth, more integrated and better use of IT allowed managers of New City to downsize more rationally and efficiently. It facilitated the transfer of personnel within departments, from middle management to the operations level, and across departments, from internally oriented to customer-oriented personnel. In doing so, managers of New City minimized operating costs while maintaining the same level of services. In contrast, IT in Old City did not facilitate such an agenda and managers downsized more superficially across the board, in all departments. Differences in IT consequences in the two cities are explained using the theory of slack resources in organizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.2.191.537","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['organizational downsizing', 'environmental pressures', 'IT investment']","The article primarily focuses on the technical aspects of IT in organizational downsizing without addressing social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

The core premise of this concept is that a proper understanding of effective interunit knowledge sharing in a multiunit firm requires a joint consideration of relatedness in knowledge content among business units and the network of lateral interunit relations that enables task units to access related knowledge. Results from a study of 120 new product development projects in 41 business units of a large multiunit electronics company showed that project teams obtained more existing knowledge from other units and completed their projects faster to the extent that they had short interunit network paths to units that possessed related knowledge. In contrast, neither network connections nor extent of related knowledge alone explained the amount of knowledge obtained and project completion time. The results also showed a contingent effect of having direct interunit relations in knowledge networks: While established direct relations mitigated problems of transferring noncodified knowledge, they were harmful when the knowledge to be transferred was codified, because they were less needed but still involved maintenance costs. These findings suggest that research on knowledge transfers and synergies in multiunit firms should pursue new perspectives that combine the concepts of network connections and relatedness in knowledge content.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.3.232.2771","","OS","Management & Organizations","2","['knowledge sharing', 'network', 'business units']","The article focuses primarily on knowledge sharing and interunit relations within a business context without addressing social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

This conflicted role offers insights into why the phenomenon of organizational knowledge has been interpreted by researchers in multiple and possibly conflicting ways. Some theories depict knowledge as an empirical phenomenon, residing in action and becoming \u201corganizational\u201d in the acquisition, diffusion, and replication of those actions throughout the organization. Others consider it a latent phenomenon, residing in the possibility for constructing novel organizational actions. This paper argues that while each of these qualities\u2014empirical and latent\u2014are intrinsic to knowledge in organizations, our understanding of organizational phenomena is essentially incomplete until the relationship between them is considered. Building on structuration theory, we propose a complementary perspective that views organizational knowledge as the product of an ongoing and recursive interaction between empirical and latent knowledge, between knowledge as action and knowledge as possibility. We ground this complementary model of knowledge in evidence from the field study of two firms whose innovation practices provide unique insights into how knowledge simultaneously enables and constrains behavior in organizations. We then discuss how a complementary perspective avoids the reification of knowledge by depicting it instead as an ongoing and social process and offers an alternative distinction between individual and collective knowledge.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.3.290.2772","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['knowledge', 'organizational', 'innovation', 'social process']","The article discusses knowledge in organizations and its dual role in enabling and constraining behavior, but it lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

The argument is made that dynamic capabilities are shaped by the coevolution of these learning mechanisms. At any point in time, firms adopt a mix of learning behaviors constituted by a semiautomatic accumulation of experience and by deliberate investments in knowledge articulation and codification activities. The relative effectiveness of these capability-building mechanisms is analyzed here as contingent upon selected features of the task to be learned, such as its frequency, homogeneity, and degree of causal ambiguity. Testable hypotheses about these effects are derived. Somewhat counterintuitive implications of the analysis include the relatively superior effectiveness of highly deliberate learning processes such as knowledge codification at lower levels of frequency and homogeneity of the organizational task, in contrast with common managerial practice.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.3.339.2780","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational learning mechanisms and dynamic capabilities without addressing any socially progressive themes such as diversity, equity, or ethics.

These perspectives suggest that, while knowledge is \u201cowned\u201d at the individual level, the integration of this knowledge to a collective level is necessary. This integration of knowledge typically takes place in groups. In our experimental study, we examine how individuals in groups engage in micro-level interactions to effectively integrate knowledge by examining the effects of using three formal interventions: Information Sharing, Questioning Others, and Managing Time. In particular, we observe that simple formal interventions can improve knowledge integration when they lead to \u201cwindows of opportunity\u201d for group members to consider ways to improve their work process that go beyond the formal intervention instructions. The most effective groups used these formal interventions to focus their attention into organized clusters of activity, during which they significantly changed their work process and improved their subsequent knowledge integration. In particular, groups in the Questioning Others and Managing Time conditions exhibited greater knowledge integration than groups in the Information Sharing and Control conditions.

What best explains whether a firm relies on market control or hierarchical control to secure required resources? How do the characteristics of the resources come into play? In this study, we consider a comprehensive path model of the governance mode decision for sourcing technological know-how. By integrating different perspectives on firm boundaries, including transaction cost economics, a resource-based view, and an options perspective, we link characteristics of the technology (i.e., uniqueness, barriers to imitation, commercial uncertainty, technological dynamism) to the perceived threat of opportunism, the potential for sustainable advantage, and the pursuit of a licensing agreement vis-\u00e0-vis the outright acquisition of the firm that possesses the desired know-how. We use structural equation modeling to analyze 127 sourcing arrangements. Our results show that technological dynamism and barriers to imitation indirectly influence the governance mode decision by increasing the perceived threat of opportunism. Commercial uncertainty directly influences the governance mode and decreases the likelihood of an acquisition vis-\u00e0-vis a licensing agreement. Although uniqueness and barriers to imitation are also positively associated with the perceived potential for sustainable advantage, the potential for sustainable advantage had no direct effect on governance mode. Implications and suggestions for further research are offered.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.4.387.2950","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of firm boundaries and governance modes without addressing any socially progressive themes or ethical considerations.

To understand the problematic nature of knowledge and the boundaries that result, an ethnographic study was used to understand how knowledge is structured differently across the four primary functions that are dependent on each other in the creation and production of a high-volume product. A pragmatic view of 'knowledge in practice' is developed, describing knowledge as localized, embedded, and invested within a function and how, when working across functions, consequences often arise that generate problematic knowledge boundaries. The use of a boundary object is then described as a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge to resolve the consequences that exist at a given boundary. Finally, this pragmatic view of knowledge and boundaries is proposed as a framework to revisit the differentiation and integration of knowledge.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.4.442.2953","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['knowledge', 'innovation', 'boundary objects']","The article discusses knowledge and innovation in the context of new product development, but it does not explicitly address themes of diversity, equity, or social justice.

I take advantage of change during China's economic reform to study the relative importance of organizational and environmental factors in producing innovative managerial response. I find that strategic choice predicted innovation in the early stages of reform, but environmental factors increased in salience over time. Intrafirm support, Communist Party connections, and a market orientation produced innovation early in reform. Simple imitation of others was also salient in early years. As reform progressed, managers increasingly imitated other profitable firms and drew on their own experience.

The Tailoring of Legitimating Accounts and the Social Construction of Identity","We empirically explore the legitimating accounts for and against policies precluding workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, focusing on how agents working at both the national level and within organizations use broader cultural accounts in building their legitimating accounts in local settings. The diffusion perspective in institutional theory has portrayed how agents import \u201cready-to-wear\u201d cultural accounts. In contrast, translation theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in part on their messages becoming \u201cautocommunicational,\u201d so that listeners identify themselves with the message.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.5.475.7814","","OS","Management & Organizations","9","['discrimination', 'social identities', 'collective action', 'cultural accounts', 'social arrangements']","The article focuses on workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and the social construction of identity, emphasizing the importance of cultural narratives and collective action for social change.

The mere perception of opportunistic behavior can lead to a breakdown in cooperation. Once damaged, the question then arises as to whether and how cooperation might be restored. Noncooperative game theory raises serious doubts about the possibilities, although interactional justice and impression management research have shown that verbal explanations can dampen reactions to aversive behavior. Philosophical, anthropological, and ethological research all suggest that genuine forgiveness may require something more tangible and substantive than an explanation. Thus, the current experiment investigated the effects of explanations and varying forms of substantive amends on the restoration of mutual cooperation. The results confirm that rebuilding cooperation is feasible. Apologies and simple explanations can be effective to a degree, though substantive amends have significantly more positive effects than explanations alone. In contrast to prior findings on interactional justice, acknowledgments were more effective than denials in repairing short interactions. This research demonstrates that, once breached, cooperation can be reestablished and that actions as well as explanations and apologies can augment the process in important and sometimes subtle ways.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.5.497.7816","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['cooperation', 'forgiveness', 'interactional justice']","The article discusses themes of cooperation and interactional justice, which indicate a moderate focus on ethical interpersonal relationships.

Comparatively little research has been conducted on how a firm develops, manages, and deploys capabilities to support its business strategy. This study seeks to understand the process of capability development and to establish a model that has both theoretical and practical significance. A longitudinal case study of the electronic commerce strategy formation and implementation at Bolsa de Valores de Guayaquil, an Ecuadorian stock exchange, yielded qualitative data that allowed inductive modeling of the capability development process. The model reveals that capability development in support of a new strategy is a gradual process that is cumulative, expansive, and very dependent on the way that difficult-to-imitate resources and actions are combined. At Bolsa de Valores de Guayaquil, actions that supported the development of the firm's capability to strategize seem to have contributed the most in the initial phase of the strategy formation and implementation; actions that helped the development of the firm's capability to be flexible appear to have contributed the most during the middle phase; and actions that supported the development of the firm's capabilities to integrate and engender trust seem to have contributed the most in the final phase. In addition, the key resources that supported the overall capabilities development process included leadership, organizational culture, information technology, long-term view, and social networks.

For this reason, external interventions are typically needed to engage a group in reexamining and moving beyond its current identity. If threatened by these external interventions, however, identity beliefs can become emotionally heated and resistant to the cognitively rational efforts of outsiders. At the same time, the insider group's emotional energy is essential to mobilize and sustain radical change. This paper draws on community development theories and practices, as well as identity theories, to develop a model that traces the dynamic processes by which hot emotional interpretations and relatively colder cognitive interpretations interact to initiate, mobilize, and sustain radical change. It highlights the roles that emotion and cognition play as both barriers and essential facilitators of the change at different stages of the process, and proposes a set of strategies for managing them.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.5.532.7812","","OS","Management & Organizations","6","['radical change', 'community development', 'identity', 'emotional energy', 'cognitive interpretations']","The article discusses radical change processes within community development, emphasizing the importance of identity and emotional engagement, which aligns with social justice themes.

This paper develops a contrary theoretical proposition. We argue that efficiency may dictate modulating between discrete governance modes (i.e., structural modulation) in response to a stable set of exchange conditions. If governance choices are discrete, as much of organization theory argues, then the consequent steady-state functionality delivered by these organizational forms is itself discrete. However, if the desired functionality lies in-between the steady-state functionality delivered by two discrete choices, then efficiency gains may be available by modulating between modes. We develop an analytical model of structural modulation and examine factors that influence when modulation is ef- ficiency enhancing, as well as the optimal rate of modulation. We conclude that under certain conditions structural modulation is efficiency enhancing. Further, contrary to theories that highlight the potentially destructive consequences of inertia on organizational survival, we identify important efficiencyyielding benefits of inertia.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.5.547.7815","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on organizational theory and efficiency without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical critiques.

As a result, organizational change has been reified and treated as exceptional rather than natural. In this paper, we set out to offer an account of organizational change on its own terms\u2014to treat change as the normal condition of organizational life. The central question we address is as follows: What must organization(s) be like if change is constitutive of reality? Wishing to highlight the pervasiveness of change in organizations, we talk about organizational becoming. Change, we argue, is the reweaving of actors' webs of beliefs and habits of action to accommodate new experiences obtained through interactions. Insofar as this is an ongoing process, that is to the extent actors try to make sense of and act coherently in the world, change is inherent in human action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human action. In this view, organization is a secondary accomplishment, in a double sense. Firstly, organization is the attempt to order the intrinsic flux of human action, to channel it towards certain ends by generalizing and institutionalizing particular cognitive representations. Secondly, organization is a pattern that is constituted, shaped, and emerging from change. Organization aims at stemming change but, in the process of doing so, it is generated by it. These claims are illustrated by drawing on the work of several organizational ethnographers. The implications of this view for theory and practice are outlined.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.5.567.7810","","OS","Management & Organizations","4","['change', 'organizational', 'human action', 'beliefs', 'interactions']","The article discusses the inherent nature of change within organizations and emphasizes the evolving nature of human action and beliefs.

Specifically, several researchers have proposed identity-based models of organizational identification but few have operationalized and tested them. Furthermore, virtually no research has explored how members identify with multiple-identity organizations. This study addresses these gaps and makes three specific contributions to identity theory. First, we operationalize and test a model in which a member's organizational identification is conceptualized in terms of an identity comparison process, i.e., a cognitive comparison between what a member perceives the identity to be and what they think it should be. Second, we extend current thinking by operationalizing organizational identification in terms of multiple and competing identities. Third, as a theory-building exercise, we explore the possibility that a similar identity comparison process operates at the organizational form level of analysis, affecting members' identification with the encompassing form or social institution. We test our model via a survey of members of rural cooperatives\u2014a prototypical \u2018hybrid\u2019 identity organizational form, embodying elements of both \u2018business\u2019 and \u2018family\u2019 identities. Results of the analyses show that organizational identity congruence has a significant effect on member commitment, and form-level identity congruence has significant effects on both cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy, lending support for the use of identity as a multilevel construct. These results provide empirical support for current identity-based models of organizational identification and expand their generalizability to include multiple-identity organizations.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.6.618.493","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['identity', 'organizational identification', 'multiple identities']","The article explores the concept of organizational identity and how members identify with multiple identities, indicating a moderate focus on social dynamics and identity theory.

Multiple methods were used to collect data on the newcomers' work experiences before and after assuming their new jobs. Repeated interviews with them during their first six months in their new jobs revealed that their past experience affected their assimilation in three primary ways: through the personal identities they had developed and carried with them, through the know-how they had acquired in past jobs and how well it fit with their new jobs, and through the personal tactics they had learned for managing their work and managing change. In general, newcomers with diverse experience adjusted better than those with narrow experience because (1) they found it easier to enact dimensions of their personal identities that allowed them to function effectively in the new situation, (2) they more easily found a fit between know-how gleaned from that experience and their new jobs, and (3) they could draw on a wider variety of personal tactics that they had previously used to help them adjust.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.6.636.495","","OS","Management & Organizations","5","['diverse experience', 'personal identities', 'assimilated', 'adjustment']","The article discusses the importance of diverse experiences and personal identities in the workplace, indicating a moderate focus on DEI themes.

Though it may bind people together behind the change initiative, strong organizationwide identification often blinds and potentially blocks the view of new possibilities. Prior research on identity change has tended to either ignore the paradox or resolve it by advocating some middle ground such as hybrid organizational identities or group-level identifications. This paper presents an identity transformation model that capitalizes on the paradoxical tensions over time by unpacking the processes by which individual and organizational levels of identity interact. It operationalizes the model by suggesting linguistic markers that describe the different stages of the process and rhetorical techniques that leaders can use to guide people through the process. To illustrate the model and its application, the paper highlights moments across a 10-year period at Tech-Co, a high-technology company undergoing a significant identity transformation.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.6.653.502","","OS","Management & Organizations","3","['identity', 'transformation', 'organizational change']","The article discusses organizational identity transformation, which touches on themes of change and identity but lacks a strong emphasis on social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

This theory focuses mainly on the impacts of firm- and industry-specific factors on the choice of entry mode, taking the effects of country-specific contextual factors as constant or less important. In contrast, the institutional perspective emphasizes the importance of the influence of both institutional forces embedded in national environments and decision makers' cognitive constraints on the founding conditions of new ventures. Still, this theoretical perspective has yet to provide insights into how institutional factors influence the choice of foreign entry mode. The primary goal of the present study is to provide a unifying theoretical framework to examine this relationship.

We suggest that through their everyday action, actors produce and reproduce a variety of temporal structures which in turn shape the temporal rhythm and form of their ongoing practices. A focus on temporal structuring, combined with a practice perspective, allows us to bridge the subjective-objective dichotomy that underlies much of the existing research on time in organizations. After developing the notion of temporal structuring, we illustrate its use in the context of a prior empirical study.

We also consider how governance design choices at the transaction level shape the effectiveness of interorganizational routizination processes. Based on a sample of 145 biotechnology alliances, we find that only partner-specific experience has a positive impact on alliance performance, and that this effect is stronger in the absence of equity-based governance mechanisms.

Given the increasing importance of innovation, it is vital to understand more about the alternative mechanism\u2014such as alliances and acquisitions\u2014that can be used to enhance the innovative performance of companies. Most of the literature has dealt with these alternatives as isolated issues. Companies, however, are constantly challenged to choose between acquisitions and strategic alliances, given the limited resources that can be spent on research and development. This paper contributes to the literature because it focuses on the choice between innovation-related alliances and acquisitions. We focus on the question of how the trade-off between strategic alliances and acquisitions is influenced by previous direct and indirect ties between firms in an industry network of interfirm alliances. We formulate hypotheses pertaining to the number of direct ties between two companies, their proximity in the overall alliance network, and their centrality in that network. In so doing, we distinguish between ties that connect firms from the same and from different industry segments, and those that connect firms from the same or from different world regions. These hypotheses are tested on a sample of strategic alliances and acquisitions in the application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) industry. The findings show that a series of strategic alliances between two partners increases the probability that one will ultimately acquire the other. Whereas previous direct contacts tend to lead to an acquisition, this is not true of previous indirect contacts, which increase the probability that a link between the companies, once it is forged, takes the form of a strategic alliance. In the case of acquisitions, firms that are more centrally located in the network of interfirm alliances tend to be acquirers, and firms with a less central position tend to become acquired. These findings underscore the importance of taking previously formed interfirm linkages into account when explaining the choice between strategic alliances and acquisitions, as these existing links influence the transaction costs associated with both alternatives.","https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.13.6.714.496","","OS","Management & Organizations","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of innovation and strategic decisions in technology sourcing without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

When a cyclic schedule is employed, the throughput is determined by a cyclic sequence of operations known as the cyclic critical path. These operations are not, in general, all performed on a single bottleneck machine. We present an algorithm for releasing jobs that treats this cyclic critical path as the bottleneck. Although this algorithm has the somewhat complex task of not delaying any of these operations on the cyclic critical path, it is greatly simplified by being able to take advantage of the fixed sequence of the cyclic schedule. The result is that the algorithm is relatively simple to implement. Although it uses a simulation\u2010based analysis, this analysis can all be done and the necessary results stored in advance of its use. We test the algorithm in a job shop environment with stochastic operation times.

The firm must decide which products to offer, how to price them, whether each should be make\u2010to\u2010stock (mts) or make\u2010to\u2010order (mto), and how often to produce them. The offered products share a single manufacturing facility. Setup times introduce disceonomies of scope and setup costs introduce economies of scale. We provide motivating problem scenarios, model the monopolist's problem as a non\u2010linear, integer programming problem, characterize of the optimal policy, develop near\u2010optimal procedures, and discuss managerial insights.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2002.tb00188.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of product offering and pricing strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

This model provides an alternative explanation for much of what other outsourcing theories predict, as well as making several new predictions. In particular, we show that outsourcing decisions can create a path\u2010dependent outsourcing trap in which a firm experiences higher long\u2010run costs after an immediate cost benefit. We also describe conditions under which outsourcing a small fraction of component production may dominate either complete insourcing or complete outsourcing.

MAGAZINEView all authors and affiliations","A NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF CAPACITATED POSTPONEMENT","Customer satisfaction can be achieved by providing rapid delivery of a wide variety of products. High levels of product variety require correspondingly high levels of inventory of each item to quickly respond to customer demand. Delayed product differentiation has been identified as a strategy to reduce final product inventories while providing the required customer service levels. However, it is done so at the cost of devoting large production capacities to the differentiation stage. We study the impact of this postponement capacity on the ability to achieve the benefits of delayed product differentiation. We examine a single\u2010period capacitated inventory model and consider a manufacturing system that produces a single item that is finished into multiple products. After assembly, some amount of the common generic item is completed as non\u2010postponed products, whereas some of the common item is kept as in\u2010process inventory, thereby postponing the commitment to a specific product. The non\u2010postponed finished\u2010goods inventory is used first to meet demand. Demand in excess of this inventory is met, if possible, through the completion of the common items. Our results indicate that a relatively small amount of postponement capacity is needed to achieve all of the benefits of completely delaying product differentiation for all customer demand. This important result will permit many firms to adopt this delaying strategy who previously thought it to be either technologically impossible or prohibitively expensive to do so.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2002.tb00190.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and production strategies without any mention of socially progressive themes, ethics, or diversity.

Northco was facing high working capital costs while also incurring high stockout and markdown costs. This paper models the impact of inventory holding cost and reactive capacity on Northco's targeted understocking and overstocking cost and offers a solution methodology for such problems. We quantify the impact of varying inventory carrying costs (and hence, high working capital costs) on stockout costs and the value of additional capacity. Our results illustrate that apparel manufacturers with high working capital costs, and hence high inventory carrying costs, should target higher stockout costs and achieve lower capacity utilization. The results presented have application beyond Northco because high working capital cost is endemic to many supply chains.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2002.tb00191.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of inventory management and profitability without addressing any social, ethical, or diversity-related themes.

It is assumed that the utility of the product varies among potential customers and decreases over time, and that a potential customer will place an order if his or her utility is higher than the manufacturer's posted price. Once an order is placed, it will be delivered to the customer after a length of time called \u201cleadtime.\u201d Because of the decrease in a customer's utility during leadtime, a customer will cancel the order if the utility falls below the ordering price before the order is received. The manufacturer may choose to offer discounted prices to customers who would otherwise cancel their orders. We discuss two price policies: common discounted price and customized discounted price. In the common discounted price policy, the manufacturer offers a single lower price to the customers; in the customized discounted price policy, the manufacturer offers the customers separately for individual new prices. Our analytical and numerical studies show that the discounted price policies results in higher revenue and that the customized discounted price policy significantly outperforms the common discounted price policy when product utility decreases rapidly. We also study two leadtime policies when production cost decreases over time. The first uses a fixed leadtime, and the second allows the leadtime to vary dynamically over time. We find that the dynamic leadtime policy significantly outperforms the fixed leadtime policy when the product cost decreases rapidly.","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1937-5956.2002.tb00192.x","research article","POM","Operations Management","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing and leadtime policies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our unbiased empirical tests indicate that cross-sectional differences in expected returns explain very little, if any, of the momentum profits.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/1/143/1619967","regular","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically momentum strategies and empirical tests, without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice."],["2002","15","1","Robert Battalio\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Robert Battalio\n            \n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004University of Notre Dame\n    \n\n    \n        Address correspondence to Robert Jennings, Finance Department, Kelley School of Business, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405-1701, or e-mail: jennings@indiana.edu.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Jason Greene\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Jason Greene\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Georgia State University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Brian Hatch\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Brian Hatch\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004University of Cincinnati\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Robert Jennings\n                                    \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Robert Jennings\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \u2004Indiana University\n    \n\n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n                                \n    \n        Predecessor papers titled \u201cLimit Order Executions on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange\u201d and \u201cA Comparison of Equity Limit Order Execution Quality Across Trading Venues\u201d existed as early as April 1996.

We connect this result to the pricing of interest rate derivatives. If the term structure model is exponential affine, then there is a linkage between the bond pricing solution and the prices of many widely traded interest rate derivative securities. Our results apply to m-factor processes with n diffusions and l jump processes. The pricing solutions require at most a single numerical integral, making the model easy to implement. We discuss many options that yield solutions using the methods of the article.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/1/195/1620056","regular","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of pricing interest rate derivatives without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, reflecting a purely profit-focused approach."],["2002","15","1","Dong-Hyun Ahn\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Dong-Hyun Ahn\n            \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Address correspondence to Prof. Dong-Hyun Ahn, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, McColl Building, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3490, or e-mail: ahnd@bschool.unc.edu.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Robert F.

We develop a comprehensive QTSM, which is maximally flexible and thus encompasses the features of several diverse models including the double square-root model of Longstaff (1989), the univariate quadratic model of Beaglehole and Tenney (1992), and the squared-autoregressive-independent-variable nominal term structure (SAINTS) model of Constantinides (1992). We document a complete classification of admissibility and empirical identification for the QTSM, and demonstrate that the QTSM can overcome limitations inherent in affine term structure models (ATSMs). Using the efficient method of moments of Gallant and Tauchen (1996), we test the empirical performance of the model in determining bond prices and compare the performance to the ATSMs. The results of the goodness-of-fit tests suggest that the QTSMs outperform the ATSMs in explaining historical bond price behavior in the United States.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/1/243/1620149","regular","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses solely on technical aspects of financial modeling without any mention of socially progressive themes such as diversity, ethics, or social justice.

In the model economy, growth rates in technology are altered by infrequent large shocks and continuous small shocks. An investor observes movements in the technology level but cannot perfectly distinguish their sources. Instead the investor solves a signal extraction problem. We depart from most of the macroeconomics and finance literature by presuming that the investor treats the specification of technology evolution as an approximation. To promote a decision rule that is robust to model misspecification, an investor acts as if a malevolent player threatens to perturb the actual data-generating process relative to his approximating model. We study how a concern about robustness alters asset prices. We show that the dynamic evolution of the risk-return trade-off is dominated by movements in the growth-state probabilities and that the evolution of the dividend-price ratio is driven primarily by the capital-technology ratio.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/2/363/1587653","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically on decision-making under uncertainty and asset pricing, without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

The average IPO leaves $9.1 million on the table. This number is approximately twice as large as the fees paid to investment bankers and represents a substantial indirect cost to the issuing firm. We present a prospect theory model that focuses on the covariance of the money left on the table and wealth changes. Our reasoning also provides an explanation for a second puzzling pattern: much more money is left on the table following recent market rises than after market falls. This results in an explanation of hot issue markets.

Recent theoretical articles have explored why or how underreaction might occur. However, the notion of underreaction is contentious. We revisit this issue by focusing on one of the most simple of corporate transactions, the stock split. Prior studies that report abnormal return drifts subsequent to splits do not appear to be spurious, nor a consequence of misspecified benchmarks. Using recent cases, we report a drift of 9% in the year following a split announcement. We consider fundamental operating performance as a source of the underreaction and find that splitting firms have an unusually low propensity to experience a contraction in future earnings. Further, analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts are comparatively low at the time of the split announcement and revise sluggishly over time. Together these results are consistent with the notion of market underreaction to the information in corporate news events.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/2/489/1588751","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on market behavior and financial performance related to stock splits without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Size and B/M portfolios exhibit momentum as strong as that in individual stocks and industries. The size and B/M portfolios are well diversified, so momentum cannot be attributed to firm- or industry-specific returns. Further, industry, size, and B/M portfolios are negatively autocorrelated and cross-serially correlated over intermediate horizons. The evidence suggests that stocks covary \u201ctoo strongly\u201d with each other.

Implications from Stock Index and Futures Return Autocorrelations","We investigate the relation between returns on stock indices and their corresponding futures contracts to evaluate potential explanations for the pervasive yet anomalous evidence of positive, short-horizon portfolio autocorrelations. Using a simple theoretical framework, we generate empirical implications for both microstructure and partial adjustment models. The major findings are (i) return autocorrelations of indices are generally positive even though futures contracts have autocorrelations close to zero, and (ii) these autocorrelation differences are maintained under conditions favorable for spot-futures arbitrage and are most prevalent during low-volume periods. These results point toward microstructure-based explanations and away from explanations based on behavioral models.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/2/655/1590010","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical financial analysis and empirical implications related to stock indices and futures contracts without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2002","15","3","Steven R.

However, in many real-world asset markets, exercise strategies cannot be determined separately, but must be formed as part of a strategic equilibrium. This article provides a tractable approach for deriving equilibrium investment strategies in a continuous-time Cournot\u2013Nash framework. The impact of competition on exercise strategies is dramatic. For example, while standard real options models emphasize that a valuable \u201coption to wait\u201d leads firms to invest only at large positive net present values, the impact of competition drastically erodes the value of the option to wait and leads to investment at very near the zero net present value threshold.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/3/691/1603237","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of investment strategies within a competitive framework, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations, thus scoring very low on the 'woke' scale."],["2002","15","3","Matthew J.

The theoretical model considers a first-price sealed bid and an English auction. We find that as debt levels increase, firms tend to reduce their bids. The lower bids give the competition incentives to reduce their bids as well. These results are investigated empirically using data from the 1994\u20131995 FCC spectrum auctions. Consistent with the theoretical model, higher debt levels of the bidding firm and of the competition tend to lead to lower bids. Additional determinants of bidding behavior in these auctions are also analyzed.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/3/723/1603314","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of bidding behavior and capital structure without any mention of social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Regressions for portfolios and individual stocks indicate that domestic factor models explain much more time-series variation in returns and generally have lower pricing errors than the world factor model. In addition, decomposing the world factors into domestic and foreign components demonstrates that the addition of foreign factors to domestic models leads to less accurate in-sample and out-of-sample pricing.

Analysts are more optimistic for the subsequent four years for issuers reporting higher issue-year accruals. The predictive power is greater for discretionary accruals than nondiscretionary accruals and is independent of the presence of an underwriting affiliation. Predicted forecast errors from accruals significantly explain the long-term underperformance of new issuers. The predictability of forecast errors among nonissuers suggests that analysts\u2019 credulity about accruals management more generally contributes to market inefficiency.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/3/869/1604322","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of financial analysis and market inefficiencies without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

With more competing banks, borrower-specific information becomes more disperse, as each bank becomes informed about a smaller pool of borrowers. This reduces banks\u2019 screening ability, creating an inefficiency as more low-quality borrowers obtain financing. Incumbent banks\u2019 information advantage may also create difficulties for potential entrants, so that entry should be easier in markets with high borrower turnover or where entrants have specific expertise in evaluating credit risks. We draw implications for whether financial deregulation is likely to increase borrowers\u2019 surplus, and what patterns of entry might be observed.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/3/901/1604444","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of the banking industry, such as information dispersion and adverse selection, without any mention of social justice, DEI, or ethical critiques.

We show that financial innovation produces some effects which hold across informational structures and others which differ.

In this article we show that if a creditor has to deal with multiple borrowers who might default, it may be optimal for the creditor to randomly reject requests for a loan workout. We further demonstrate that the optimal acceptance rate used by a creditor is positively related to the liquidating cost and negatively related to the default benefit. Our model is particularly relevant when analyzing the default decisions of mortgage borrowers and small business owners.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/3/959/1604765","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of foreclosure and liquidation costs without addressing any social justice themes, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Using a simple model in which investors trade to share risk or speculate on private information, we show that returns generated by risk-sharing trades tend to reverse themselves, while returns generated by speculative trades tend to continue themselves. We test this theoretical prediction by analyzing the relation between daily volume and first-order return autocorrelation for individual stocks listed on the NYSE and AMEX. We find that the cross-sectional variation in the relation between volume and return autocorrelation is related to the extent of informed trading in a manner consistent with the theoretical prediction.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/4/1005/1567663","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of finance, specifically the relationship between stock volume and returns, without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes."],["2002","15","4","Kalok Chan\n                                    , \n\n                                    \n\n    \n        \n    Kalok Chan\n            \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Address correspondence to Kalok Chan, Department of Finance, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clearwater Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, or e-mail: kachan@usthk.ust.hk.\n    \n    \n        Search for other works by this author on:\n    \n\n\n    Oxford Academic\n\n\n    \n        Google Scholar\n    \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Y.

Stock net trade volume (buyer-initiated volume minus seller-initiated volume) has strong predictive ability for stock and option quote revisions, but option net trade volume has no incremental predictive ability. This suggests that informed investors initiate trades in the stock market but not in the option market. On the other hand, both stock and option quote revisions have predictive ability for each other. Thus, while information in the stock market is contained in both quote revisions and trades, information in the option market is contained only in quote revisions.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/4/1049/1567860","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of stock and option trading without addressing any social justice, ethical considerations, or themes related to diversity, equity, or inclusion."],["2002","15","4","Charles R.

I drop this assumption in experimental asset markets. Outcomes are qualitatively consistent with theoretical models when the number of insiders is disclosed prior to trade. When it is not, insiders use the timing and size of trades interactively to hide from the dealers and each other, dealers have difficulty identifying insider trades, and liquidity patterns do not differ as a function of the number of insiders. In general, insider behavior has strategic dimensions not admitted in Kyle (1985) and extensions.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/4/1077/1567940","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on market microstructure and insider trading without any reference to social justice, ethics, or diversity themes.

Using Helsinki Stock Exchange data, we find that upstairs trades tend to have lower information content and lower price impacts than downstairs trades. This is consistent with the hypotheses that the upstairs market is better at pricing uninformed liquidity trades and that upstairs brokers can give better prices to their customers if they know the unexpressed demands of other customers. We find that these economic benefits depend on price discovery occurring in the downstairs market.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/4/1111/1568004","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on empirical evidence related to trading practices and market efficiency without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical concerns.

This article solves the dynamic portfolio choice problem of a U.S. investor faced with a time-varying investment opportunity set modeled using a regime-switching process which may be characterized by correlations and volatilities that increase in bad times. International diversification is still valuable with regime changes and currency hedging imparts further benefit. The costs of ignoring the regimes are small for all-equity portfolios but increase when a conditionally risk-free asset can be held.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/4/1137/1568247","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of international asset allocation and investment strategies without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

The isomorphism can be used to mechanically transform known solutions not involving habit formation to corresponding solutions with habit formation. For example, the Constantinides (1990) and Ingersoll (1992) solutions are mechanically obtained from the familiar Merton solutions for the additive utility case, without recourse to a Bellman equation or first-order conditions. More generally, recent solutions to portfolio selection problems with recursive utility and a stochastic investment opportunity set are readily transformed to novel solutions of corresponding problems with utility that combines recursivity with habit formation. The methodology also applies in the context of Hindy\u2013Huang\u2013Kreps (1992) preferences, where our isomorphism shows that the solution obtained by Hindy and Huang (1993) can be mechanically transformed to Dybvig\u2019s (1995) solution to the optimal consumption-investment problem with consumption ratcheting.","https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/15/4/1189/1568352","original article","RFS","Finance","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of asset pricing models without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Our approach minimizes data snooping given the information set and the priors. We compare the prior views of a skeptic and a confident investor.

When the bargaining advantage rests with the multinational, equity participation restrictions can increase the profits to domestic firms and encourage suboptimal investment policies. Overinvestment occurs when the multinational's bargaining advantage is reinforced by an informational advantage, while underinvestment occurs when the domestic firm possesses the informational advantage.

Customized exotic derivatives are typically better than vanilla contracts when correlations between prices and quantities are large in magnitude and when quantity risks are substantially greater than price risks.

It explores the extent to which product relatedness with both foreign and local parents affects IJV performance as perceived by venture managers. After controlling for relevant variables, analysis of the data containing 134 IJVs in China validates our major premise: the relatedness of an IJV's products with that of its foreign and local parents is positively associated with its performance. An IJV maintaining bilateral related diversification (i.e., with both parents) performs better than a venture maintaining a unilateral related linkage (i.e., with one parent), which in turn outperforms an IJV which is unrelated to either parent. When resource complementarity or goal congruity between parents is higher, there is a stronger positive relationship between product relatedness and IJV performance. When structural opportunities are fewer or institutional deterrence is higher, there is a weaker positive relationship between product relatedness and IJV performance.

Banks increasingly compete outside of their home countries, and operating environments often differ sharply across countries, both in terms of financial markets and credit risk. In this paper, we report the results of an empirical test of the liability of foreignness in the global banking industry, using Fitch\u2013IBCA BankScope data for the period 1989\u201396. Our findings strongly support the liability of foreignness hypothesis. Further, the data show some evidence that the X-efficiency of a foreign-owned bank is strongly influenced by the competitiveness of its home country and the host country in which it operates. Lastly, we find that in some environments U.S.-owned banks are more X-efficient than other foreign-owned banks in some environments, but less X-efficient in others.

In this study, we use an experimental design to examine the strategic choice decision-making process in firms located in the United States and Japan. We develop several main-effect propositions regarding managerial selection of competitive strategies, depending on the competitive forces (buyer power, threat of substitutes, threat of new firm entry, and high intensity of rivalry) they are facing. We propose a main effect due to country of origin: Japanese managers prefer a cost-leadership strategy more than American managers do. We also propose several interaction effects regarding cross-national differences in strategy selection between Japanese and U.S. managers. To test our propositions, we collected experimental data from 316 U.S. executives and 459 Japanese executives. We assessed relative impacts of the competitive forces on strategic decision-making using a multilevel regression analysis. The research findings indicated that high buyer power and high substitution threat were associated with a preference for cost-leadership strategies, and Japanese managers were significantly more likely to prefer a cost-leadership strategy than U.S. managers. We also found that, under conditions of high buyer power, U.S. managers were less likely than Japanese managers to enter a market with a differentiation or focus strategy. We found little support for other interaction hypotheses, suggesting points of similarity between U.S. and Japanese managers. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications of our results.

We argue that contract and cooperation are not substitutes but complements in relation to IJV performance. An IJV contract provides an institutional framework guiding the course of cooperation, while cooperation overcomes the adaptive limits of contracts. Our analysis of 293 IJVs in a dynamic market demonstrates that previous cooperation bolsters contractual adaptability, which in turn nurtures current cooperation between the same partners. We find that contract completeness and cooperation drive IJV performance both independently and interactively. When contracts are more complete, cooperation contributes more to performance. Contract and cooperation differ in their quadratic effects such that the contribution of contract completeness to performance declines as completeness increases but the contribution of cooperation remains linear.

We find that the data are consistent with the expectation that multiple sources of value creation exist in synergistic cross-border acquisitions: asset sharing, reverse internalization of valuable intangible assets, and financial diversification. Gains accrue to bidder firm shareholders only for the least fungible of these sources of gains, i.e., reverse internalization. For value-destroying acquisitions that are expected to be driven by managerialism, we find that the data are consistent with only one of the sources of value destruction that we examine, i.e., risk reduction. In these acquisitions, the evidence also suggests that the relative size of the target to the bidder mitigates the negative effects of risk reduction.

One unstated implicit assumption in that model is that each bidding firm in the resource market is ignorant not only of the content of rival firms' private information, but also of the quality (i.e., the noisiness or reliability) of that information. Consequently, that model does not qualify as a rational-expectations Bayesian Nash equilibrium\u2014a fact that both generates questionable results (e.g., the possibility of negative expected profits) and impedes any effort to extend the model. The rational-expectations critique in economics points out that this sort of nonrational assumption becomes increasingly implausible as economic actors learn more about each other's patterns over time through repeated interactions (in this case, as bidders repeatedly compete against each other to buy different resources over time). So, over the long run, the only truly stable, viable, and robust assumption would be rational-expectations behavior. The primary purpose of this paper is to put Makadok's model on the firmer methodological footing of rational-expectations Bayesian Nash equilibrium, so that it will no longer generate questionable results, and so that future researchers can more easily extend it. The secondary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this shift to rational-expectations assumptions has little substantive impact on the testable hypotheses generated by Makadok's original model.

This work has demonstrated that managers develop strategic group knowledge structures in order to make sense of their competitive environment. This study extends this line of research by examining the complexity evident in the strategic group knowledge structures developed by firms' top management teams and assessing the relationship between complexity in these knowledge structures and subsequent firm performance. Specifically, we examine the complexity of top managers' knowledge structures regarding their competition using a sample of 76 top management teams from banks in three U.S. cities. Using hierarchical regression, we find a significant relationship between the complexity of cognitive strategic groups and subsequent firm performance. These results suggest that the structure of the cognitive templates that top managers use to understand their environment and the actions of their competitor influence the degree of strategic success of their firm.

It explores the role of resources and capabilities in manufacturing plants that cannot be easily duplicated, and for which ready substitutes are not available. Such resources and capabilities are formed by employees' internal learning based on cross-training and suggestion systems, external learning from customers and suppliers, and proprietary processes and equipment developed by the firm. Based on data from 164 manufacturing plants, the paper empirically demonstrates that competitive advantage in manufacturing (as measured by superior plant performance) results from proprietary processes and equipment which, in turn, is driven by external and internal learning. The implication is that resources such as standard equipment and employees with generic skills obtainable in factor markets are not as effective in achieving high levels of plant performance, since they are freely available to competitors. The paper also demonstrates the important role of internal and external learning in developing resources that are imperfectly imitable and difficult to duplicate.

We analyze capability-seeking aspects of foreign direct investment by examining the relationship between upstream (technological) and downstream (marketing) capabilities and the choice between acquisition and greenfield modes of international entry. In analyzing 2175 entries by British, German, and Japanese investors into the United States, we find that for downstream capabilities, which tend not to be geographically fungible, the absolute level of capabilities in the entered industry explains the mode choice. However, for upstream capabilities, which tend to be geographically fungible, the acquisition motive stems from a relative capability differential between host and home country firms. These results have implications for the concept of fungibility in the resource-based view of the firm as well as for the literature on sourcing of resident assets by foreign firms, which has thus far ignored issues of entry mode and downstream assets.

Our approach is similar to earlier studies of interfirm performance heterogeneity across industries. Drawing on theories of industry evolution, we hypothesize that the performance of entrants will have higher variance than incumbents. Further, given the opportunities offered by price deregulation, we propose that incumbents will have higher variance in performance under deregulation than in the earlier regime. The findings indicate that entrant performance heterogeneity is significantly greater than incumbent performance heterogeneity following deregulation, but that the variation in performance among incumbents does not significantly change when deregulation occurs. The second result is surprising given the range of service and process innovations that incumbents initiated. These results suggest that the distinction between entrants and incumbents is critical to future studies of performance variation within and across industries.

Following this reasoning, most FDI research has focused on advantages foreign investors must possess to overcome whatever disadvantages they face. Research directly investigating the sources of foreign subsidiary disadvantages has been notably lacking, despite the fact that understanding disadvantages could uncover ways to reduce exposure to these liabilities of foreignness and improve management of FDI. This study focuses on whether labor lawsuit judgments represent a liability for foreign subsidiaries operating in the United States (U.S.). Specifically, I tested whether 486 British, German, and Japanese subsidiaries operating in the U.S. had more labor lawsuits brought to judgment than a matched sample of U.S.-owned firms. Results indicate that foreign subsidiaries faced significantly more labor lawsuit judgments in both federal and state jurisdictions. I also investigated several variables hypothesized to be associated with a reduction in labor lawsuit judgments facing foreign subsidiaries. Foreign subsidiaries who used American top officers or whose parent firms had more U.S. operations faced fewer lawsuits, while foreign subsidiaries using human resource professionals actually faced more labor lawsuit judgments. Implications of these findings and avenues for future research are discussed.

There is little direct evidence to verify these claims, yet a substantial literature encourages firms to formulate competitive strategies around resources with these attributes. Further, work outside the resource-based tradition suggests that these attributes can slow innovation, and it is not clear when this effect outweighs the benefits of inimitability. This paper seeks to clarify whether and how the complexity, tacitness, and specificity of a firm's knowledge affect the persistence of its performance advantages. We find that the complexity and tacitness of technological knowledge are useful for defending a firm's major product improvements from imitation, but not for protecting its minor improvements.

While financial economists hold that manager-controlled firms tend to reflect higher levels of diversification, strategy researchers argue that ownership and diversification are not systematically related. In throwing light on this debate, this study uses a fine-grained definition of ownership groups to explore how the different objectives and monitoring predispositions of distinct ownership groups might influence diversification strategy. The empirical examination is set in India to offer a striking contrast from the predominantly U.S.-based studies that have shaped the ongoing debate. Findings show that diverse ownership groups adopt different postures in monitoring and/or influencing organizational diversification. While some ownership groups are closely associated with focused strategies, and some encourage diversification, others are quite indifferent. These results suggest that the context-specific variation among ownership groups is germane to our understanding of diversification strategy.

Next, we present data from a content analysis of 126 change studies which suggest that strategy researchers tend not to recognize those requirements. Indeed, the typical approach used to measure and test change (as a simple difference between two measures of the same variable) is usually inappropriate and could lead to inaccurate findings and flawed conclusions. We conclude by offering suggestions for how change can be studied more rigorously.

At the same time, a much larger number of firms escape the various costs associated with litigation by adhering to the provisions of the same laws and regulations. It is not a priori apparent why this dichotomy exists. In this paper we draw on corporate governance and stakeholder theories to empirically investigate environmental lawsuits. Specifically, we compare the pre-lawsuit profile of 209 violators to a sample of matched control firms between 1994 and 1998. We find that the likelihood of becoming a lawsuit defendant increases with board size, with the fraction of directors in industrial firms, and with the fraction of inside ownership, and decreases with the number of directorships held by outside directors. These findings are robust to alternative dependent variable specifications. Together, our results suggest that managers, researchers, and policy-makers need to direct their attention to the corporate board as the core decision-making unit forming corporate environmental policies.

Pay dispersion may increase effort and provide incentives for high workforce performance levels, but may also inhibit cooperation and goal orientation among employees. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives (individual motivation, institutional theory, organizational justice, and neoclassical economics), this study predicts that pay dispersion will be associated with higher levels of workforce performance when accompanied by formal individual incentive systems and independent work, while pay compression is desirable in the absence of individual incentive systems and when work is interdependent. Survey research studies in two industrial sectors (the motor carrier and concrete pipe industries) were conducted to address these issues. Interactive regression results were generally supportive of the predictions across several measures of workforce performance (accident rates, safety violations, and productivity).

The first is that Ronald Coase, best known as the forefather of transaction cost theory, foresaw many of the critical questions that proponents of the resource-based view are concerned with today. The second is that resource-based theory plays a potentially much more critical role in economic theory and in explaining the institutional structure of production than even many resource-based scholars recognize. The last point is that a more complete understanding of the organization of economic activity requires a greater sensitivity to the interdependence of production and exchange relations. The arguments presented in this paper highlight important, but relatively ignored, elements in Coase's work that inform strategy research. More importantly, this paper makes the case for a triangular alignment between the triumvirate of governance structure, transaction, and resource attributes and demonstrates how the identity and strategy of a particular firm influences how its resources interact with the transaction and how the firm chooses to govern it. The general argument is then applied to the context of interfirm collaborative relations, where the key focus is broadened from just cost to also include skills/knowledge and the interdependence between cost and skills with respect to firm boundaries, both in terms of choice and nature. Such a broadening of focus enables us to additionally examine the transacting process as a productive endeavor, which underpins the co-evolution of the competencies of partner firms.

The mechanistic perspective based on disciplinary-based theories, the design model, and a view of strategy as a planned posture, has provided a unified view, but a narrow and increasingly less pertinent one. The advent of organic developments that included strategy process research, evolutionary and process models, and interactive and integrative views, has provided richness and pertinence, but not a unified perspective. These two progressions marked an epistemological shift from mechanistic to organic assumptions: from discrete to incessant time, from directional to interactive flow, and from differentiated to integrated constructs and models. Building on this shift, this paper proposes an organic perspective that combines the insights and coherence of the mechanistic perspective with the more relevant organic ideas. It makes use of the organic assumptions to advance a view of strategy as an adaptive coordination, introduce the Organization\u2013Environment\u2013Strategy\u2013Performance (OESP) integrative theoretical model, and present an organic model of strategic management. The organic perspective provides a basis for an upgraded, more unified, and better-attuned view on strategy's core issues.

That is, we know little about the micro-level mechanisms by which assets are built, nor do we have sufficient empirical evidence why some assets are more difficult to imitate, trade, or substitute. In this exploratory paper, we attempt to provide a better understanding of asset accumulation via an empirical research program in pharmaceutical drug discovery. Using a combination of field research, discovery data from nine pharmaceutical firms, and data on 218 alliances involving new technologies for experimentation and testing, three causes affecting asset accumulation are identified and described. First, the difficulty of imitating a particular asset is affected by interdependencies with other assets. Second, trading of assets can be impeded by structural inertia in the core of a firm that is adopting the technology asset. And third, fully specifying all factors affecting imitation and trading ex ante is very difficult, if not nearly impossible, under conditions of rapid technological change. We propose that the complex interactions of these causes can give rise to imperfections in factor markets. Finally, implications for further research are discussed as well.

This paper takes a longitudinal perspective and argues that how much a firm benefits from having foreign subsidiaries depends on its process of internationalization. We argue that a firm's capacity to absorb expansion is subject to constraints: some expansion patterns increase profitability less than others, owing to diseconomies of time compression. We hypothesize that the speed of internationalization, the spread of the geographical and product markets entered, and the irregularity of the expansion pattern negatively moderate a firm's increase in profitability resulting from international expansion.

However, the present paper suggests that Penrose's direct or intended contribution to resource-based thinking has been misinterpreted. Penrose never aimed to provide useful strategy prescriptions for managers to create a sustainable stream of rents; rather, she tried to rigorously describe the processes through which firms grow. In her theory, rents were generally assumed not to occur. If they arose this reflected an inefficient macro-level outcome of an otherwise efficient micro-level growth process. Nevertheless, her ideas have undoubtedly stimulated \u2018good conversation\u2019 within the strategy field in the spirit of Mahoney and Pandian (1992); their emerging use by some scholars as building blocks in models that show how sustainable competitive advantage and rents can be achieved is undeniable, although such use was never intended by Edith Penrose herself.

Knowledge inventory management involves acquiring, retaining, deploying, idling, and abandoning technologies. Because of future opportunities to switch technologies over time, managing knowledge inventories requires valuing flexibility. Real option theory presents normative conceptual frameworks and pricing formulas for valuing flexibility. These formulas assume managers consider the full time horizon of technologies as well as all available substituting and complementary technologies. This study considers the implications of violations of these assumptions (i.e., temporal and spatial myopia) for managers' technology investment decisions. Specifying decision criteria under alternative forms of myopia reveals possible sources and patterns of technology management decision errors.

While the phenomenon of disruptive technologies has been well documented, the underlying theoretical drivers of technology disruption are less well understood. This article identifies the demand conditions that enable disruptive dynamics. By examining how consumers evaluate technology and how this evaluation changes as performance improves, it offers new theoretical insight into the impact of the structure of the demand environment on competitive dynamics. Two new constructs\u2014preference overlap and preference symmetry\u2014are introduced to characterize the relationships among the preferences of different market segments. The article presents a formal model that examines how these relationships lead to the emergence of different competitive regimes. The model is analyzed using computer simulation.

We find that firms with greater alliance experience and, more importantly, those that create a dedicated alliance function (with the intent of strategically coordinating alliance activity and capturing/disseminating alliance-related knowledge) realize greater success with alliances. More specifically, firms with a dedicated alliance function achieve greater abnormal stock market gains (average of 1.35%) and report that 63 percent of alliances are successful whereas firms without an alliance function achieve much lower stock market gains (average of 0.18%) and only a 50 percent long-term success rate. We also find a positive correlation between stock market-based measures of alliance success and alliance success measured through managerial assessments. In addition to providing insights into the development of alliance capability among firms, this paper is one of the first to provide empirical support for the efficient markets argument by demonstrating that the initial stock market response to a key event positively correlates to the long-term performance and value of the event.

Using data from a sample of information service exchanges, we find empirical support for this proposition of complementarity. Managers appear to couple their increasingly customized contracts with high levels of relational governance (and vice versa). Moreover, this interdependence underlies their ability to generate improvements in exchange performance.

In our model, mobility barriers, strategic interactions among high performers, dynamic capabilities (the mechanisms that allow winners to continue to survive), and boundary of rivalry are put together to derive their joint implications for the evolution of strategic groups. Not surprisingly, our model behavior shows that mobility barriers and strategic interactions play an important role in sustaining intergroup performance difference. However, the extremely high level of mobility barriers is shown to impede the emergence of strategic groups. We also find that dynamic capabilities and boundary of rivalry are as essential as mobility barriers in understanding the emergence and stability of strategic groups. When dynamic capabilities are absent or when rivalry is extended over firms with dissimilar strategies, strategic groups are less likely to exist. These findings can serve as a guideline for empirical research to probe why strategic groups exist sometimes and why they do not at other times.

Based on survey responses from 73 Singapore and 89 Hong Kong firms with respect to their joint ventures set up in China, the results indicate that both overseeing effort and management involvement are significant channels of knowledge acquisition. The former channel is more important for firms with a great deal of operational experience in China and for parents of older joint ventures. This finding indicates that firms improve their skills of knowledge acquisition through learning-by-doing. Moreover, the strategic importance of the venture concerned, instead of the learning intent of the parent, is the driving force behind the allocation of resources to the two channels. This implies that firms mainly learn through managing their key joint ventures. Since a venture that provides novel and fruitful learning experience may not, and need not, be an operation of great strategic importance, this finding suggests the existence of learning myopia.

This extends current theoretical and empirical research by specifying and empirically demonstrating three interrelated yet distinct dimensions of social capital. Firms vary in their levels of social capital not just on their structural position in an alliance network but also in the dynamics that underlie alliance formation and maintenance.

The influence of organizational governance on technological performance","This paper investigates how firms' decisions to outsource or internalize production affect their technological performance. While several popular arguments and some anecdotal evidence suggest a direct association between outsourcing and technological performance, the effects of firms' governance decisions are likely to be contingent upon several specific attributes underlying a given exchange. This paper first demonstrates how standard performance models can improperly suggest a positive relationship between firms' outsourcing decisions and their technological performance. Models that account for firm- and transaction-specific features are then presented, which indicate that neither outsourcing nor internalization per se result in superior performance; rather, a firm's technological performance is contingent upon the alignment between firms' governance decisions and the degree of contractual hazards.

We provide an empirical test of Barney and Chatterjee's arguments by examining the role of the respective resource contribution of the target and the acquirer. Combining an event study with a survey of postacquisition resource transfer on a sample of 101 horizontal acquisitions, we find that acquirers do not earn abnormal returns when they only receive resources from the target. In this case, it is likely that multiple bidders, which could have equally captured these resources, competed away all the abnormal returns from the successful bidder. In contrast, we find that acquirers can expect to earn abnormal returns when they transfer their own resources to the target. Overall, we find that value creation does not ensure value capture for the acquirer.

Textbooks often recommend adjusting the residual income capital charge for market risk, but not for firmspecific risk. We demonstrate two basic flaws in this recommendation. First, the capital charge should not be adjusted for market risk. Charging a market risk premium results in \u201cdouble\u201d counting because a risk\u2010averse manager will personally consider this risk. Second, while investors can avoid firm\u2010specific risk through diversification, a manager cannot. If the manager faces significant firm\u2010specific risk at the time he makes his investment decision, then it is optimal to charge him less than the riskless return so as to partially offset his reluctance to undertake risky investments. On the other hand, the manager will vary his investment decisions with the pre\u2010decision information he receives, which accentuates his compensation risk, and the firm must compensate him for bearing this additional risk. Hence, if the manager will receive relatively precise pre\u2010decision information, then it is optimal to charge him more than the riskless return to reduce the variability of his investment decisions.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/1/1/2624/Cost-of-Capital-in-Residual-Income-for-Performance","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of performance evaluation in accounting without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

Firms engaged in oil exploration and drilling are exposed to two kinds of risks that can cause earnings volatility: oil price risk and exploration risk. Firms can use abnormal accrual choices and/or derivatives to reduce earnings volatility caused by oil price risk, but cannot directly hedge the operational risk of unsuccessful drilling. Because hedging and using abnormal accruals are costly activities, and because prior research suggests managers do not eliminate all volatility (Haushalter 2000; Barton 2001), we expect that, at the margin, managers will use these smoothing mechanisms as substitutes to manage earnings volatility. Our results suggest a sequential process whereby managers of oil and gas producing firms first determine the extent to which they will use derivatives to hedge oil price risk, and then, especially in the fourth quarter, manage residual earnings volatility by trading off abnormal accruals and hedging with derivatives to smooth income.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/1/127/2635/The-Interaction-between-Accrual-Management-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of accrual management and hedging in the oil and gas sector, with no mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical considerations.

Because the characteristics of the firm's capital assets determine the realized manufacturing cost, the firm has an incentive to distort its investment choices in order to receive a more favorable tax transfer price. This represents an ex ante form of shifting income across divisions. Practical difficulties in enforcing the regulations provide the firm with another way to shift income. In particular, regulators often can identify only a range of acceptable transfer prices. As a result, the firm will not use the true \u201carm's length\u201d transfer price, but will instead choose a transfer price that is more favorable for tax purposes. I find that the opportunity to shift income ex post in this manner may reduce the value of investment\u2010based ex ante income shifting. That is, if the firm has more discretion over the ex post transfer price, then it may invest more efficiently ex ante. Although it is commonly perceived that ex post income shifting is purely deleterious, the analysis shows that it may have benefits.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/1/161/2628/Ex-Ante-and-Ex-Post-Discretion-over-Arm-s-Length","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of transfer pricing and tax regulations without any mention of social justice, diversity, or ethical critiques.

We provide evidence on how management earnings forecast disclosure differs between the United States (U.S.) and Canada, two otherwise similar business environments with different legal regimes. Canadian securities laws and judicial interpretations create a far less litigious environment than exists in the U.S. We find a greater frequency of management earnings forecast disclosure in Canada relative to the U.S. Further, although U.S. managers are relatively more likely to issue forecasts during interim periods in which earnings decrease, Canadian managers do not exhibit that tendency. Instead, Canadian managers issue more forecasts when earnings are increasing, and their forecasts are of annual rather than interim earnings. Also consistent with a less litigious environment, Canadian managers issue more precise and longer\u2010term forecasts.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that after firms disclose FRR No. 48\u2010mandated information about their exposures to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and energy prices, trading volume sensitivity to changes in these underlying market rates and prices declines, even after controlling for other factors associated with trading volume.

We expect public banks' shareholders to be more likely than private banks' shareholders to rely on simple earnings\u2010based heuristics in evaluating firm performance, so we expect public banks to have more incentives to report steadily increasing earnings. Consistent with this expectation, we find that relative to private banks, public banks: (1) report fewer small earnings declines, (2) are more likely to use the loan loss provision and security gain realizations to eliminate small earnings decreases, and (3) report longer strings of consecutive earnings increases. These results suggest that the asymmetric pattern of more small earnings increases than decreases, first documented by Burgstahler and Dichev (1997), is attributable to earnings management and is not simply a reflection of the underlying distribution of earnings changes.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/3/547/2670/Earnings-Management-to-Avoid-Earnings-Declines","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of earnings management in banking without addressing any social justice, ethical critiques, or diversity themes.

I present analytical models of a traditional system and a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system. The VMI system is a supply\u2010chain management technique in which the retailer delegates its inventory decisions to, and shares its internal accounting information with, the manufacturer. With VMI, the parties aim to reduce inventory\u2010related costs and increase supply\u2010chain profits. The theoretical analysis indicates that the system that produces higher supply\u2010chain profits depends on the extent to which the retailer reveals its internal accounting information to the manufacturer and the ability of the manufacturer to accurately receive and use this information in its decisions. Survey data corroborate the model's prediction that manufacturers are more likely to select VMI when retailers provide more precise sales and inventory (i.e., demand) information and when the manufacturers' systems ensure reliable transmission and receipt of this information. The study's results suggest that managerial accountants should consider the retailer's willingness to share sales and inventory information with the manufacturer and the manufacturer's ability to reliably transmit this information before implementing VMI systems.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/3/653/2667/The-Effect-of-Information-Precision-and","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of supply chain management and does not address any socially progressive themes, such as diversity, equity, or ethical considerations in business practices."],["2002","77","3","William R.

Our measure of complexity reflects both the mix of different products the dealer orders as well as features and options the dealer selects for each product in the order. We find that EDI is associated with faster order processing, independent of complexity, and that EDI mitigates most of the negative effects of complexity on processing time. We also find that dealers learn to submit error\u2010free orders to the manufacturer, and that previous errors provide feedback that helps dealers submit more accurate orders.

The results from our experiment show that using budgets for both resource allocation and performance evaluation not only eliminates budget slack, but also increases subordinates' effort and task performance. Additionally, we find that an internal reporting system that provides information about subordinates' budgets and performance to their co\u2010workers mitigates budget slack when superiors do not use budgets as a basis for resource allocation. These results highlight the synergies between the planning (resource allocation) and control (performance evaluation) functions of managerial accounting practices such as budgeting.

Building on the repeated\u2010sample framework established in Brown and Warner (1980, 1985) and Dyckman et al.

Our conclusions are particularly relevant when power is critical (i.e., when sample sizes are small or anticipated investor response is small).

Consistent with our expectations, we find that (1) the higher the firm's dividend yield, the more negative the firm's stock price reaction to the increase in the individual income tax rate (i.e., the dividend tax rate) enacted in the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, and (2) institutional holdings mitigate this negative reaction.

This conflict not only could be an artifact of the restrictiveness of the abnormal earnings forecasting equation we estimate, but it also calls into question whether investors assess correctly the effect of ESOs on profitable software firm value.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/4/971/2680/The-Valuation-Implications-of-Employee-Stock","articles","TAR","Accounting","1","[]","The article focuses on technical aspects of employee stock options and their valuation implications without addressing any social justice, diversity, or ethical themes.

We find that firms that expected to pay their CEOs less than $1 million actually increased their CEOs' cash compensation, contrary to Congress's expectations. Moreover, the magnitude of the unexpected increase in compensation is proportional to how far the CEO's expected compensation fell below Congress's new $1 million reasonable\u2010compensation standard. Thus, our study provides evidence that some of the largest U.S. corporations responded in a manner contrary to policymakers' expectations. Our findings also support the theory of implicit contracting costs, by demonstrating that many firms reacted in an economically rational fashion when a change in the tax law decreased their implicit costs of CEO compensation.","https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/77/4/997/2685/Federal-Tax-Legislation-as-an-Implicit-Contracting","articles","TAR","Accounting","2","['executive compensation', 'tax legislation', 'implicit contracting']","The article primarily focuses on the economic implications of tax legislation on executive compensation without addressing broader social issues or ethical considerations.
